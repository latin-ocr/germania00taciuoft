INTRODccrloN To THE GERMANIA xxi

of the facts which it presents, it is well to bear in mind
that Tacitus, a Roman, wrote for Romans and not with
an eye upon the demands of a later age. We must re-
member that he was intent, not merely on (lisseminating
information, but on imparting to his work the most
artistic form of which his talent was capable. In this
latter object he has been eminently successful, even
though the niceties of criticism force us to confess that

However, we do not have to divest ourselves of modern
literary ideals and adopt those of his own day to become
sensible to the charm and the appeal of the Germania.
But it is something more than a work of literary art.
Judged as an array of facts, it holds a position all its
own. How far it would maintain preeminence in this
respect, iri case, by some impossible miracle, the works
of all the other authors who dealt with the same theme

it stands as an indispensable repertorium for all who en-

Germanic forefathers. It is, as it were, the golden mili-

literary sources of later ages and the scientific application
of linguistic evidence have thrown a flood of light on
many obscure details. Since the nineteenth century
