26 NOTES

4. insularum: including the Scandinavian Peninsula, re-
garded for centuries after Tacitus as an island. — nuper z this word
may be extended in meaning to include an event not too remote
in the past; cf. the indefiniteness of our expression ‘⁶ in modern
times ‘’ and the extensibility of such Latin words as antiquitus,
vetas, et. cet. See note on Ayricola 1. 2. The furthest advance
of Roman forces in these regions was achieved in 5 A.D.‚ when
an expedition under the command of Tiberius penetrated as far
as the Cattegat. Roman fleets also operated along the German
coast of the North Sea in 12 ΒΕ. under Drusus and in 15 and
16 A.D. under Germanicus—cognitis . . . gentibus: a loose
ablative absolute construction, added to justify the assertion
made with reference to the vast extent of the peninsulas and
islands.

5. aperuit: cf. the similar metaphor in Ayricola 22. 1: tertius
annzcs . . . novas qenais aperuit.

6. vertice ortus: the Rhine proper is actually formed by the
confluence of two tributariesy the ‘ Hinter ’ Rhine and the
‘ Vorder ’ Rhine, which rise in different parts of the Swiss canton
Grisons. The source of the Vorder Rhine is near St. Gotthard,
ancient Adula, the vernem here referred to.

7. versus: a participle, refiexive in force.

8. molli et clementer edito: cf. our English expression “ a
gentle slope’'; there is a contrast with inaccesso ac praecipiti.

9. Abnobae: the name applied in ancient times to the Black
Forest. The source of the Danube is on the eastern slope.—
pluris: here equivalent to compluris.

10. donec . . . erumpat: as is not infrequent in late Latin,
donec introduces a subjunctive in a statement of fact where
classical usage would demand an indicative—septimum os:
almost without exception, Greek writers, from the time of He-
rodotus on, assigned five mouths to the .Danube. Among the
Romans, traditional computation after the Augustan age declared
for seven, which the fame of the Nile Delta rendered a favored
. number for rivers' mouths. Thus Vergil, Aeneid 9. 30, ascribes
seven outlets to the Ganges. As a matter of fact the Danube,
before entering the Black Sea, divides into three branehes,
the Kilia, the Sulina, and the St. George's; the Kih'a dis-
