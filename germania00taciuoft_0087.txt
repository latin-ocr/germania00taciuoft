21. 20, who refers (as does Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 5. 56. l)
to the armatum concilium of tho Gauls: ·in iis nova terribilisque
species visa est, quod armati — teu mos yemis erat — in concilium
venerunt.

12. per sacerdotes: as representatives of the gods, in whose
name a sacred truce, observed during tho session, was pro-
claimed. In Homeric times tho officials who convened the
assembly were not the priests but the heralds, who were, how-
ever, sacrosanct as being under the protection of Zeus; hence

their epithets θεῖοι, ‘ divine‚' and Διὶ φίλοι, ⁴ dear to Zeus.' — et γ

coercendi: a breach of the peace would be an offense against the
gods, for whom the priests would act as deputies in inflicting
punishment, precisely as in the case of infractione of military dis-

herald also devolved the task of keeping order in the assembly
and quelling disputants; cf. Iliad 7. 274.

by official position, i.e. membership in the body of the con-
sulares, praetorii, et cet., within these classes by seniority, and
was not subject to variation in favor of such elements of per-
sonal prestige as decus bellorum, facundia.

16. concutiunt: they clnslz one upon the other. The Gauls

employed this method of applause under similar circumstances;
cf. Caesar, Bellum Gallicam 7. 21. 1.

Chapter 12.

The judiciary; the penal code.

1. accusare quoque : the assembly was not only a deliberative
body but could also legally exercise judicial functions. —- dis-
crimen capitis intendere: to lay a charye involviny capital pun-
ishment. ’

3. arboribus suspendunt: among the Greeks and the Romans
hanging was resorted to as a means of suicide; strangulation,
