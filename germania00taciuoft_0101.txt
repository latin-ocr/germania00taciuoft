NOTES 69

ὅ. praesens et maritis permissa: the Lex I ulia, enacted by
Augustus in 17 B.C.‚ restricted such privato vengeance in Rome
and subjected the offender to due process of criminal law. In
earlier times the husband, by virtue of the patria poteslas which
he possessed, could slay a guilty wife at once.

6. nudatam . . . expellit: according to Maspero, Peuplcs
de l'Orient, 1, p. 736, in ancient Chaldaea an adulterous woman,
clothed only in a loin cloth, was driven into the street, and left
to the mercy of the passers-by.

⁷. publicatae . . . venia: sor the surrender os chastity meets
with no mercy. The harshness, as judged by the Roman stand-
ards of the time of Tacitus, of the punishment meted out to
the adulteress, is explained by this generalizing comment on the
uncompromising attitude of the Germans toward the fallen
woman, married or single. This attitude is elucidated by the
conteitt following.

8. aetate: youth.

9. invenerit: the subject for the moment uppermost in the
mind of Tacit‘us is the unmarried woman who has lost her virtue;
naturally, he intended that the reader should regard it as
sels-evident in the light of the context that the denounced
adultera could not hope for a second husband—nemo . . .
ridet: a pessimist's side thrust at the Roman code of social
ethicS.

10. saeculum: the spirit os the times or the way os the world;
cf. Pliny, Epistulae 10. 97 ; ‘nam el pessimi exempli nec nostri saeculi
est (‘ for (such an act) is of the nature of the worst precedent
possible and is not in accord with the spirit of our age ’). --
melius quidem adhuc: still better even,· supply faciunt or a like
verb.

With the frequency os divorce and remarriage in Roman
society in mind, Tacitus speaks with approval of the lengths to
which conjugal loyalty was carried by the women — nothing is
said as to the men — of certain states in which the remarriage
of widows was frowncd on. Such imposition of wifely loyalty
has expressed itself variously among different ωερε, in the social
neglect and degradation of the widow, in hor enforced suicide;
cf. the Suttee of the Hindoo widow.
