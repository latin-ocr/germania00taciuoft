Archaeological reso-arch has fully confirmed the statement of
Tacit-us and even supplemented it; the remains prove that not
only the horse but other domvstio animals also accompanied the
master to the pyro, The presence. in graves of the Roman
period, of the bones of swine, sheep, and goats probably indicates
that popular belief dictated the propriety of supplying the
departed with means of subsistence in the other world.

In Rome the immolation of animals at the pyre was not un-
known; in the time of Tacitus and Pliny, the notorious juris- ·
consult, Regulus, in the extravagance of his grief at the death of
his son, killed at the pyre the boy's ponies, dogs, and pet birds ; see
Pliny, Epistulae 4. 2. 3. The tone of the letter sufficiently shows

cavity and the ground over it was raised only to a slight elevation
above the surrounding level. The bustum of sod, familiar to
Tacitus, presented the natural foil to the pyramidal and cylindri-
cal stone sepulchers to be seen in and about Rome, hence is
cited as the tomb par excellence of an unpretentious civilization,
by an author who was intent on making a contrast‚ and not on
presenting details with modern archaeological precision.
