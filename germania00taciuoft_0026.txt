xviii INTRODL’CTION To THE GERMANIA .

According to the ancient criteria, of far greater moment
in gaining the approbation of his readers than modern
canons of taste would insist on in a work of corresponding
content, were the presentation and manipulation of his
material with a view to stylistic effectiveness. Although
in the Germania Tacitus was handling a subject that
would have lent itself to dry, encyclopedic treatment,
the desire of esthetic appeal to his audience was as omni-
present as it was in the composition of the Aqricola,
notwithstanding the intrinsic difference in the themes
of the two pieces. His favorite rhetorical devices and
the stylistic mannerisms characteristic of this period of
his writing are apparent throughout, from the typical
locution in the first sentence, mutuo metu aut montibus
separatur, to the poetic coloring of the idealization of
the life of the wild Fenni in the last chapter. The con-

in the Aqr-icola are also discernible in the Germania.

It was not in consonance with the literary method of
Tacitus frequently to refer by name to his authorities.
Thus, in the Germania specific sources are disguised in
such formulae as memoriae proditur, accepimus, quidam
opinantur, eorum opinionibus accedo. Direct allusion is
made to one author only, viz. Julius Caesar, who in chapter
28 is termed summus auctorum. In this passage as well
as elsewhere in an instance or two, Tacitus reveals familiar-

complimentary estimate of Caesar’s credibility, Tacitus
derived no data from him excepting the single quotation.
Tacitus in numerous details stands at variance with his
predecessor, and, as a whole, his picture of German civiliza-
tion is far in advance of that presented by Caesar. Be-
