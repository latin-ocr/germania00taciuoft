34 NOTES

the North Sea ; Tacitus projects in thought the reader and himself
to the region which he is describing.

11. Asciburgium: a military post on the left bank of the
Lower Rhine. The name perhaps survives in the modern
Asberg‚ situated north of Cologne‚ near Dusseldorf.

12. hodieque: :hodie quoque, even lo this day.

it had been indulged in at all. Translate: by 720 intermarriaqes,
promiscuously contraclecl with various races. — infectos: con-
taminated .· some editors attach to the word the ’milder connota-
tion, modified.

4. tamquam . . . numero: so far as can be judqed in the case
of so qreat a population.

5. truces et caerulei oculi: the Gauls assured Caesar’s soldiers
that the mien and the glances of the Germans struck terror to
the hearts of their antagoantS, Bellum Gallicum 1. 39. 1 ; caeruleus
