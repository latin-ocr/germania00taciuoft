11. subterraneos specus: utilized by various races in an-
tiquity for different purposes. Xenophon and his army en-
countered them in Armenia, where they served at once as
stableS‚ store-rooms, and places of abode. Similar chambers
have been found in modern times in these regions; see H. F.
Tozer, Turlcish Armenio, p. 396. Vergil, Georyics 3. 376, de-

2. cetera: otherwise this applies only to the garb worn in
the house. —totos dies . . . agunt: some editors take ayo in
its common intransitive sense, equal to vivere, and explain
dies as an accusative of duration. However, such passages as
Dialoyus 7, non diem laetiorem eoi, Historiae 3. 38, quod . . .
