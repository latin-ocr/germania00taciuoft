rhetorical nature ; cf. the locution of the same type in Livy, 21. 4.
perfidia (Hannibalis) plus quam Punica—deinde: next in
position, i.e. to the north, since Tacitus in his description pro-
ceeds from the interior to the sea.

The tribes here named, united in a cult group, were located
north of the Elbe, in the vicinity of llamburg and Li'ibeck, and
still farther to the north in Schleswig-liolstein. The Anglii
or Angles, the later invaders of Britain, may be definitely placed
along the east coast of Schleswig, north of the Kiel canal. The
neighboring Varini were closely related to them.

6. in commune: they are united in a cult association—
Nerthum: closely analogous to the rites of Nerthus here de-
scribed were those celebrated in Rome, during the Empire‚ in
honor of Magna Mater or Cybele. A feature of the festival of
Magna Mater was the lavatio, performed on March 27 of each
year;, the cult symbol of the goddess, the famous meteorite
brought from Phrygia in 205 13.c., was placed on a car drawn
by cows, and was escorted by a processioa to a small tributary
of the Tiber,‚the Almo. The idol, the chariot, and the other
paraphernalia of the cult underwent a ceremonial lustration in
the waters of the brook.

It seems probable. therefore, that, after the fashion of the
Roman student of comparative religion (see also note on 3. 1),
Tacitus has identified Nerthus with Magna Mater on the basis
of these striking external resemblances in cult rites and did not
possess any accurate information as to the essential nature of
the German goddess. She is commonly regarded as the feminine
counterpart of a male divinity, Njordr‚ worshiped by the Norse
peoples as a god of fertility, the weather, and trade.

⁷. Terram matrem: Stress has been laid on the fact that
Nerthus is defined, not as Magma Mater but as Terra Mater;
hence the theory has been advanced that Tacitus intended
that his readers should regard her, not as the German Cybele,
but as a goddess of the earth and vegetation, comparable to
the Roman Tellus (also Terra) Mater, whose festival was cele-
brated on April 15 and who stood in close connection with the
Manes as a divinity of the lower world; see, e.9.‚ Suetonius,
Tiberius 85. This view, however, presupposes a ritualistio
