and 171-168 13.c. A century later Mithradates recruited from
them especially efficient forces.

4. sede: permanerem os abode: they were not nomads as were
the Sarmatae.

5. sordes omnium: a quality attributed in chap. 20. 1 more
particularly to the children. — torpor procerum: said with
reference to times of peace; recall the general description of the
lethargic existence of the members of the comitatus quociens
bella non ineunt, chap. 15. 1.

6. foedantur: they show debasement.

7. ex moribus: Sarmatarum is understood.

9. hi . . . inter Germanos: Tacitus was ignorant of
the basic ethnological distinction between Teuton and
Slav.

10. pedum usu ac pernicitate: habitual riders are proverbially
clumsy when on their feet, and besides are generally handicapped
by an apparel or equipment primarily designed for life in the
saddle. Thus, in Historiae 1. 79, we read that the Rhoxolani,
a Sarmatian tribe, were quite helpless as foot-soldiers. The Huns
of later history were also inefficient infantrymen, since they were
shod with shapeless boots which impeded their steps (Ammianus
Marcellinus, 31. 2. 6); the high-hecled boots of the traditional
American cowboy are ill-adapted to walking.

12. in plaustro: in such folk migrations as that of the Cimbri
and the Teutons, wagons were in daily use among the Germans.
— equo . . . viventibus: the Scythians and the Huns were por-
trayed as performing on horseback such habitual acts of every-
day life as eating, drinking, and sleeping; cf. Ammianus Mar-
cellinus, 31. 2. 6.

13. foeda paupertas: the level of culture attributed by Tacitus
to the Fenni is practially on a par with that of the famous African
pygmies. ——non arma: their arrows, employed as a means of
obtaining sustenance, were used only against wild animals, a
state of affairs which coincides with life in the pacific long-ago
approved by Tibullus, 1. 10. 5-6:

An m'hz'l ille miser (the inventor of “ cold steel ”) meruit, nos
ad mala nostra

vertimus in saevas quod dedic ille seras?
