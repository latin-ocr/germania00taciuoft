20. facilior usui: more serviceabte; the right “ change‚’‘ as we
say, could be made more easily with a large number of coins of
small denominations. — promiscua: common wares.

Chapter 6.

Weapons; military tactics and formations; the code of honor.
“ 1. ne ferrum quidem: mention of the precious metals is
logically succeeded by reference to iron among the Germans, and
this forms an easy transition to the following description of arms
and warfare.-—superest: is present in abundance. Remains
found in mounds in the region of the Elbe would indicate that,
at least among the peoples of this locality, iron was present in
large quantities.

2. rari gladiis: rari is not to be taken with strict literalness;
the use of the sword was merely relatively less frequent than that
of the framea (see below). In chap. 18 the sword is mentioned
as a usual article of the marriage dower; the use of short swords
was a. racial characteristic of the East Germans; cf. chap. 43.
Thus swords were scarcely a rarity in primitive Germany‚ taken
by and large. They may, however, have been seen but seldom
in the hands of the tribes of West Germany and it was with
these that the Romans came in closest contact. — lanceis:
these had stout shaftS, broad iron heads, and were used only
for thrusting.

3. frameas: the framea, styled by Tacitus except in this
treatise simply hasta, was the characteristic national weapon of
the Germans. In comparison with the pilum of the Romans the
shaft seemed excessively long and the iron head short. In
Christian literature framea means ¹ sword ’; thus in the Latin
Bible it is the regular equivalent for ῥομφαία. Cf. the analogous
development in meaning of ἐ’-γχος, in Homer ‘ spear,’ in the
tragedians ‘ swords '

5. vel comminus vel eminus: notwithstanding the words of
Tacitus here, there was a limit to the effectiveness of the framea
at close quarters3 cf. Annales 2. 21: (Germani) . . . yenere puynae
et armorum superabantur, cum i'nyens multitudo artis locis prae-
longas hastas non protenderet, non colliyeret (⁴ the Germans were
put at a disadvantage by the nature of the combat and the style
