54 NOTEs

4. certis: regularly appointed. Regular sessions were held

period, but two or three times a year.

6. auspicatissimum initium: on the advice of the prophet-
esses, Ariovistus avoided battle until the time of the full moon,
Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1. 50; the Spartans refused to march
to the aid of the Athenians at Marathon until the moon was at
