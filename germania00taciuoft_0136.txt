104 Norns

7. oblectationi oculisque: best handled in translation as a
hendiadys; with oculis, nostris or Romanis is understood.

Tacitus writes as though the battle were a huge gladiatoria]
contest, staged by the gods for the benefit of the Roman troops
who witnessed it. There was, however, the additional satis-
faction that the strife of the Germans helped secure the position
of Rome.

9. odium sui : for a similar sentiment as to the value to Rome
of dissension among native raees, see Aqricota 12. 4-5: nec aliud
adversus validis-sinnas (sentis pro nobis utilius quam quod in com-
mune non consulant.——urgentibus imperii fatis: to interpret
these words, as has been done by some editors, as implying that
the last hour of Rome is drawing near and that the destruction
of the Einpire by the Teutonic peoples is threatening, is out of
keeping with the lively hopes as to the principate of Trajan ex-
pressed in Ayricota 3. 1-4: quamquam primo statim beatissimi
saeculi ortu . . . auyeat . . . cotidie felicitatem temporum Nerva
Traianus. Compare also the statement as to Rome's expansion
in Germania 29. 9: protulit . . . magnitudo populi Romani ultra
Rhenum, et cet. Fatis is not doom, but destiny, ‘⁴ star of Empire,”
which, of course, carries with it heavy responsibilities. The
thought may be rendered : under the stress os (our) imperial destiny.

Chapter 34.

The Dulgubnii, the Chasuarii, and the Frisians.

1. a tergo ; as the words a fronte Frisii indicate, the Chamavi
and the Angrivarii are thought of as facing west and northwest
toward the sea. Hence α teryo means to the south and east. —
Dulgubnii ε east of the NVeser, in modern Hanover. — Chasuarii:
loeated on the right bank of the Ems‚ along the Hase.

3. Frisii: they extended along the coast of Holland between
the Rhine and the Ems. Their nameland their place of abode
have remained unaffected by the vieissitudes of history. — exci-
piunt: this verb develops the meaning of ‘ coming next to‚’
precisely as does Greek ἐκδέχομαι; see, e.9., Herodotus 4. 39:
ἀπὸ ταύτης (τῆς Περσικῆς ἀκτῆς) ἐκδεκομένη ἡ Ἀσσυρίη καὶ ἀπὸ Ἀσσυρίης ἡ
Ἀραβίη (‘ and next to Persia Assyria, and to Assyria Arabia '). ——
maioribus minoribusque: Tacitus is the only ancient author
