Chapter 2.

The origin of the German race; its reputed progenitors; ex-
tension of the name.

1. ipsos: as in ΙΑςινίεοία 13. 1, the pronoun marks a transition
from physical geography to peoples.

2. hospitiis: as a result os relations os hospitalz'ey (established -
with non-German peoples).—-terra : zeugma with advehebantur is
involved: supply adveniebant.

3. olim: in primitive limes—classibus advehebantur: Taci-
tus’s rejection of the possibility of folk migration by land is, of
course, out of keeping with the facts of history. He had espe-
cially in mind the mythologieal traditions as to the wanderings of
the peoples of the Mediterranean Rasin, ey. Greeks, Trojans,
and Phoenicians.

4. ultra: used attributively‚ as in Ayricola 30. 16: nulla iam
ultra qens. Translate: beyond the limits os the known world.—
adversus: lyiny over aqainst us. The word does not necessitate
the assumption of an allusion to the spherical shape of the earth,
a view which Tacitus did not accept, as is clear from Aqricola 12.
The Ocean is in imagination transferred to a separate quarter of
the earth fronting the known world; it is a hyperbole common
among Roman writers to refer to a remote clime as ‘ another
world '; Pliny, Natural History 4. (27). 96: clarissima est Sca-
dinavia incompertae maqnitndinis . . . qaae (i.e. Hillevionam
qens) alterum orbem terrarum eam appellat (⁶ most famous (of these
islands) is Scadinavia, (a land) of unknown vastness, . . . the
race of the Hilleviones calls it another world ’); sometimes, as
in this passage, the boldness of the conception is tempered by the
insertion of a limiting word or clause; thus Velleius Paterculus,
a historian of the time of Tiberius, writes in 2. 46. l : cum . . .
in Britanniam traiecisset exercitam„ alterum paene . . . quaerens
orbem (⁶ when . . . he had transported his army to Britain, in
quest of what is well nigh another world ⁷).
