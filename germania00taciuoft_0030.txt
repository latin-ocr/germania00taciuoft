xxii INTRODUCTION To THE GERMANIA

service in uncovering the vestiges of Teutonie civiliza-
tion from the Stone Age on. These discoveries have
modified certain items found in the Germania and have
largely supplemented it; but the accuracy of Tacitus
has also been confirmed in an impressive fashion. In
any case, the Germania has been and must remain a
necessary adjunct to our apparatus of scholarship in
its field. The testimony of the book and that of the
remains interact.

It was a fortunate impulse which moved a leader in
the intellectual life of his time, a gifted representative
of the highest culture, to paint, while they lived in their
land of forest, marsh, and mountain, those peoples who,
in a few centuries, were to follow “the star of empire''
to the south and the west, and, by destroying old worlds‚
were to make way for new. In modern Germany elassical
philologists and Germanic specialists have joined hands
in the study of the Germania, with an enthusiasm sus-
tained not alone by the spirit of scholarshjp, but by a
patriotic fervor. Their pride in the possession of this
monument of their antiquity and the intensity of their
interest in it should be shared by the descendants of
Angles and Normans in all lands and elimes.
