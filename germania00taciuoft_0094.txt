found in ancient graves in Germany. — torques: metal rings‚
worn as armlets or collarS. These, as well as phalerae, were
decorations bestowed on Roman soldiers as rewards for bravery.
—pecuniam accipere docuimus: bribery of native chieftains
had on more than one occasion served Rome as an effective
device in her dealings with her northern foemen. Transactions
of this kind, carried on by Domitian with Chariomerus, king
of the Cherusci and Deoebalus, king of the Dacians, were still
fresh in the public memory when Tacitus was writing the Ger-
mamm· cf. also chap. 42. 10 and Historiae 4. 76: pecuniam ac
dona, quis solis corrumpantur (Germani) ('v money and giftS,
the sole means by which the Germans are corrupted ²).

Habitations and houses.

1. nullas urbes: walled towns of some size, such as had been
from time immemorial the civic centers typical of Greek and
Roman ljfe. We hear of oppida among the Germans, but these,
though fortified, were not intended as places of permanent
residence; like the stockades of pioneer times in this country,
they were places of refuge in time of war. The Roman regarded
the founding of walled towns as marking a milestone in human
progress; cf. Lucretius, De Rerum Natura 5. 1108:

condere coeperunt urbis arcemque locare
praesidium reyes ipsi sibi perfugiumque

(‘kings began to found cities and to lay out a citadel as a
buttress to their power and a place of refuge ')‚ echoed by Horace,
Satires 1. 3. 104—105:

. . . dehinc absistere bello,
oppida coeperunt munire et ponere leqes

(‘ then they began to cease from war, to‘ fortify'towns, and to
enact laws ’). On isolation of residence as an attribute of bar-
barism, see Ayricola 21. 2.

2. sedes: it has been assumed ordinarily that this word
means dwellinys, hence that this clause merely anticipates the
thought of the context vicos locant, et cet. A recent and plausible
explanation takes the word in the common sense of tribal seat
