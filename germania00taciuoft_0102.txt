70 NOTEs

12. semel transigitur: αη end is made once sor all. The spirit
of devotion which kept a woman content with one marriage was
highly approved by the Romans themselves in early times (see
Valerius RIaximu& 2. 1. 3), nor was appreciation of it entirely
foreign to social ideals under the Empire, as the frequent recur-
rence in epitaphs of the epithet univira shows ; cf. also Propertius

in the beautiful Consolatio Quintiliae 4. 11. 36; also 67—68:
filia . . .

fac teneas unum nos imitata virum

(⁴ Daughter . . . look to it that in emulation of me, you cleave
to one husband ³). Such writers as Juvenal, with his reference,
Satires 6. 229-230, to a woman who had eight husbands in five

rife in Roman society under the Empire. It was to offset this

celebrated Lex Papia Poppaea. (cf. on Aqricola 6. 3), by which
he sought to foster parenthood by imposing disabilities on celi-
bates and childless persons, and eonserring prerogatives on
fathers of families.

16. adgnatis: here in the sense of younger children, born
after the heir. — necare flagitium habetur: in his zeal for ideal-
izing German folkways at the expense of Roman, Tacitus has
fallen into misstatement. Exposing insants at the behest of
the father——a practice the legal justification of which was a
blot on ancient civilization in general—obtained among the
Germans as well as elsewhere. On the reported prevalence of
infanticide in Rome in the days of the Empire, see Lecky, His-
tory os European Morals, 2. chap. 4. p. 24 f.

18. bonae leges: such as the Lem Papia Poppaea: for the
sentiment compare Propertius, 4. 11. 47—48:
