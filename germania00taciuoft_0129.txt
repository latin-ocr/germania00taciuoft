12. agunt: the verb has a different shade of meaning with
each ablativo pair: they live on the German side of the Rhine
but they side with us.

13. adhuc: still, to this dags. The Batavi had been expelled
from their original abode; the Mattiaoi still occupy their native

which, strengthened and extended by Trajan, Hadrian, and An-

the Rhine not far above Bonn, to Hienheim on the Danube, near
