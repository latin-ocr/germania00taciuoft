33. femina dominatur z probably a myth and perhaps founded
on a popular etymology which compared Kaz'uulaz'set, i.e. ‘ Low-
landersff the name of a Finnish tribe, with an old German word
for woman preserved in Engl. quean, queen. In later times a
racc of Amazons was localized in the far north.

Chapter 46.

The Eastern Peoples.

1. Peucinorum: the name is here used as coextensive with
Bastarnae (see below), a Germanic race of which the Peucini,
so-called from Πεύκη, ‘ Isle of Pines‚’ their dwelling-place in the
delta of the Danube, were strictly only a branch. The hesitancy
on the part of Tacitus in classing the Peucini as Teutons is
clearly based merely on their proximity to non-Germanic
peoples and on the hybrid physical type which resulted
from their intermarrying with the Sarmatae. —Venedorumz
they were Slavs — compare the later German designation
W ends — who lived east of the Vistula, in Poland and adjacent
regions.

2. Fennorum : dwelling in Northern and Northeastern Russia.
The connection of the name with latter-day Finn, is unmistak-
able ; however, it does not follow from this fact that the ancestors
of the enlightened race of modern Finns are to be sought among
these peoples to whom Tacitus attributes so low a scale of
civilization. —- Sarmatis ε see note on 1. 2. The life here ascribed
to them, that of the typical nomads, wandering on horseback or
in wagon-houses in quest of pasturage for their herds, is paralleled
by the picture given by Herodotus of the Scythiam, who once
stretched northward from the Danube and the Black Sea. The
Scythians had been merged with the Sarmatae as the result of
conquest and assimilation.

3. Bastarnas: this brave and warlike people‚ so early as
200 B.c., had established itself in the lands north of the lower
Danube, after an emigration that was first in the historical
series of Germanic rasse movements to the south. Here they
were brought into immediate contact with both Greece and Rome,
for they served as allies of Philip V of Macedon and of his son
