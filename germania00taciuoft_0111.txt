frenzied loves '); also odes 1. 18. 8. For this use of ut see

Germania 2. 14.

⁷. transiguntur: arc dispatclzed.

9. adsciscendis principibus: adoptiny leaders or forming] rela-
tionships with leaders. The expression is apparently chosen to
emphasize the extent to which power of decision rested with the
constituency and is widely comprehensive. Such alliances with
principes of other tribes, as are mentioned in chap. 14, could
come under this head. Probably, however, Tacitus wasthink-
ing chiefly of the canvassing at these “ business and political
dinners '' of the merits of the native principes available for
duces in war or for district judges (chap. 12). It is easily con- ·
ceivable that the party strife existing between rival principes,
such as is attested by Annales 1. 58: et inieci (Seyesces) catenas
Arminio et a factione eins iniectas perpessus sum (‘ I both put
fetters on Arminius and suffered those placed on me by his
partisans’), was a prolific source of “ rixae '' between their
adherents on these occasions.

11. simplices: quileless. They acted in the spirit of the
proverbial in vino veritas and would have agreed with the senti-
ment οἱ ovid, Ars Amatoria l. 241—242:

tunc (i.e. post merum) aperit mentes aevo rarissima nostra
simplicitas, artes excutiente deo (Baccho)

(¹ then artlessness, well nigh a stranger to our times, unbars
the thoughts, when the god (of wine) doth banish wiles’).
12. ad magnas incalescat: quite in the vein of the famous

lines of Burns,

“ Inspiring‚ bold John Barleycorn!
What dangers thou canst make us scorn‚”

but among the many descriptions, ancient and modern, of “the
heart who great and puffed up with this retinue doth any deed
of courage and this valour comes of sherris,‘’ Bacchylides, Frag.
20 (Blass) has not been improved upon: ‘That power sends a
man’s thoughts soaring; straightway he is stripping cities of
their diadems of towers, — he dreams that he shall be monarch
of the world;—— . . . such are the raptures of the reveller’s

soul.' J ebb’s trans.
