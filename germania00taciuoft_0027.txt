ῙΝἹἫΟῙ)υυτιο).Υ To THE GERMANlA xix

sides Caesar, a series of authors, Greek and Roman, had
devoted more or less attention to Germany and the
Germans before Tacitus essayed 10 treat the subject.
Worthy of especial mention are Posidonius, Livy, who
in book 104 discussed the geography of Germany and
the customs of the people, the annalist Aufidius Bassus,
an immediate successor to Livy and the author of a
work cited as Libri Belli Germanici, Pliny the Elder, in
whose multifarious literary achievemcnts was included -
a complete history in twenty books of the wars which
the Romans had waged with the Germans. Owing to
the loss of these works and others which might con—
ceivably have served him, and because of the absence of
surface references in the Germania, it is impossible to
fix the sources from which he derived particular data.
We ,are reduced to speculation in which possible sources
figure far more extensively than probable.

Dependence on the Bella Germaniae of Pliny may be
assumed with great confidence. The title of this work
as given by the younger Pliny, Epist. 3. 5, by no means
justifies the conclusion that the contents comprised
merely records of campaigns. That such a work might
contain descriptions of races and institutions is demon-
strated by Caesar's Gallie W ar. It is certain that Tacitus
would have found in the Bella Germaniae ready to his
hand a mass of the sort of material of which he stood in
need. The elder Pliny had seen service in Germany
and wrote as an eye-witness. He was a compiler of
amazing industry, an observer who did not depend on
memory to recall what he had seen but had notes taken
on the spot. This work of his was used by Tacitus in
writing the Annals; see Αηη. 1. 69.
