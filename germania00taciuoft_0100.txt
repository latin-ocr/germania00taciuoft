that they are to dwell with husbands that are soldiers and
warriors and that they should put on such ornamental attire
as is not luxurious but plain? ’ Chauncy’s translation.

14. auspiciis: an apposite word, suggested by the place of
the auspicia in the Roman marriage ceremony. Originally
the auspices were taken as an essential preliminary to the rite;
in the time of Cicero divination from entrails had superseded
the auspicia proper and even thjs was not invariably resorted
t0; see De Divinatione 1. chap. 16. In the Empire, though
the practice itself seems to have fallen into disuse, traces of it
survived in the participation in the ceremony‚ as sponsors and
witnesses‚ of the so-called auspices nuptiarum. Hence auspiciis
here should not be translated merely by the bcyinninq but rather
by the initial ceremonial. Incipiencis is redundant.

17. denuntiant: proclaim.

18. quae: serving in a double capacity as object of accipiant
and subject of referantur.

were prolific sources of social depravity under the Empire, as
many allusions in the poets and satirists show. See Fried-
lander, Roman Lise and Manners under the Early Empire, Eng.
Trans, 1, p. 245 f. ’

3. litterarum secreta: secret missives; Tacitus does not say
that the Germans did not know how to write, though there is
reason to believe that this was the case, generally speaking, but
simply that they were not schooled in the use of the billet doux
as an instrument of inti-igue. Ovid’s Amores 1. 11 and 12 are
literary illustrations of the device.
