hence is sacrosa11‹¹t; wc may recall the Ζεὺς ξείνιος of the Greeks
and the ιΙιι· hospitales of the Romans, also ‘⁴ The Lord pre-
servvth the strang‹›rs‚‘’ Psalms 146. ἕ), and Odys-say 9. 270:
Ζεὺς . . , ξείνιος ὃς ξείνοισιν ἅμ’ αἰδοίοισιν ὀπηδεῖ (⁴ Zeus , ,

protector of guests, who attendeth on revered stranger
