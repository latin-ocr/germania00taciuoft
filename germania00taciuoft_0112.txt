80 NOTEs

13. adhuc: sem,- there is a contrast between the candor of
the si1nple-lwarted Germans in their cups and the reticence of
the sophistioatod and politic man of civilization; see Ovid,
Ars Amatoria l. 241—2‚ quoted above, aevo rarissima nostro
simplicitas. — secreta pectoris, et seq.: a sentiment as old as
Homer, ‘ wildering wine that sets even a wise man on to sing
aloud . . . and uttereth a word that were better left unsaid‚’
Odyssey 14. 463 f.‚ and often repeated since but never more
effectively than by Horace; cf. odes 3. 21. 14 f.:

la sapientiam
caras el arccmum iocoso
consiliam releyis Lyaeo

(⁴ thou dost unveil the broodings of the wise and the secret pur-
pose by the spell of the jocund Releaser ’); see also Epistulae
1. 5. 16; quid non ebrietas desionat? Operla recludit, et seq.
(‘ what doth not the cups disclose? They reveal the covert
thought ’) ; cf. also Satires 1. 4. 89.

These parallels have been quoted to show how through this
whole context Tacitus writes in the language and presents the
sentiments of the literature of conviviality; the parallels fur-
nish the best commentary on the passage.

14. retractatur: (the discussion) is reopened.

15. salva . . . ratio est: the reyard belonqiny to each occasion
is preserved. .

16. nesciunt: in poetry nescire is often used as a synonym of
non posse, hence here nesciunt commended itself as a variant of
the following non possant; ef. Vergil, Georqics 3. 83-4: tum, si
qua sonam procul arma dedere, stare loco nescit (equus); Horace,
Ars Poetica 390: nescii vose missa reverti ,· for a similar collocation
of the two verbs see PrOpertius, 1. 5. 23—4: nec tibi nobilitas
polerit succurrere amanli; nescii Amor priscis cedere imayinibus
(⁶ nor will high lineage have power to reseue thee when thou
dost love; Cupid knoweth not surrender unto ancestral por-
traits ⁹). — dum errare non possunt: an overstatement for
the sake of an epigrammatic ending. An interesting parallel
to this whole context is furnished by Plutarch’s discussion,
Symposiaca 7. 9 and 10, as to the wisdom of following the custom
of the Persians and “ debating state affairs midst the euPS.’‘
