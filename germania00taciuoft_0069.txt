Neres 37

(⁸ gold has banished honor. gold purchases Justieo·s det-reos, law
follows in the train of gold. and anon the sense of shame, oneo
law is gone ’).

9. nullam Germaniae venam: over fifteen years later,
when Tacitus was writing the Annals, ho had learned of tho
presence of small deposits of silver near modern wios-baden: μί’.
Annales 11. 2οε in ayro Mattiaco recluserat (Curtius Rusus) specus·
quaerendis venis arconti et seq. (⁴ in the territory of the Mattiaci
Curtius Rufus had opened up mines in a quest for veins of
silver'). ·

10. haud perinde: not especially: literally there is an ellip-
tical comparison‚ ac aliae nationes or the like, as in Amicola
10. 21.

11. est videre: like the Greek ἔστιν ὁρᾶν.

12. principibus: here used in a broad sense, i.e. lzeadmen,
including chieftains and kings.

13. quae humo finguntur : unlike the arqentea vasa, the earthen-
ware was of domestic origin. We have learned from the excava-
tion of prehistoric tombs that the Germans had a pottery tech-
nique reaching back to very primitive times. —— quamquam : and
yet,· the clause limits the preceding sentence—proximi: i.e.
to the Roman frontier. The numismatic finds amply confirm
the assertion of Tacitus that, in his time, only the Germans who
lived close to the boundaries had coins, and that these were
exclusively of Republican mintage.

15. formas: types. — adgnoscunt: they know well.

17. probant: they welcome.

18. serratos bigatosque: supply nummos; the coins hero
referred to are two types of the silver denarius, which were not
issued after the middle of the first century n.c. The former had
milled edges, the latter was stamped with the picture of a biqa
or two-horsed chariot. Besides the natural partiality of peoples
in any age for currency of a long-established value (compare the
standing of the English sovereign and the French Napoleon
nowadays)‚ another reason for the Germans' preference lay in the
, fact that in the time of the Empire. notably after Nero, tho
κ denarius was debased with a bronze alloy.

19. adfectione animi: penchant.
