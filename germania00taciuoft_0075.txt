5. animadvertere: to inflict capital punishment. The Roman
general in the field had power of life and death over his men. an
authority symbolized by the attendant lictors and their fasces.
— ne verberare quidem: in eonseious contrast with conditions in
the Roman army, where a flogging inflicted by the centurions was
a common punishment. In the mutiny of the Pannonian and
German legions (14 A.t›.), the seourgings which they had suffered
formed one of the grievances of the malcontents: Annalesl. 17:
verbera et vulnera . . . sempiterna (⁴ blows and wounds (were) con-

tinual'); 1. 35: nudant universi corpora . . . verberum notas
exprobrant (⁴ all as one man bare their bodies . . . give voice to -
reproaches because of the scars of floggings '). — nisi sacerdoti-

bus: accordjng to Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 6. 23. 4. command-
ers-in-chief did wield power of life and death. Caesar, influ-

'rac-itus, conditions may have changed. Caesar's assertion,
Bellum Gallicum 6. 21. 1; neque druides habent, qui rebus divinis
praesint, neque sacrificiis student, in so far as it tends to minimize
the functions of the priest in German life, is also at variance with
the conditions portrayed by Tacitus, who, although he does not
imply the existence of a hierarehy comparable with the Druids,
assigns important prerogatives to the priest. The priest is the
authorized instrument of divine punishment, presides over
divination (chap. 10), has power to enforce silence in council
(chap. 11).

7. quem adesse . . . credunt: besides Tiu and Wodan, the
chief war gods of German mythology, Donar‚ Freyr‚ and other
divinities were endowed with martial character and pictured as
participating in battles.

8. effigiesque et signa: in chap. 9 Tacitus says that the
Germans did not make statues portraying the gods in human
form. E ffiqies were images of animals symbolizing the gods and
sacred to them; thus the wolf was the animal of Wodan, the
boar of From, the bear of Donar. The custom here referred tois
mentioned also in Historiae 4. 22; depromptae silvis lucisque
serarum imaqines, ut cuique qemi inire proelium mos est (‘ effigies
