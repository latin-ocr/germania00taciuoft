a racia! trait of barbarous 1w‹)plcs; cf. sor example, Francis
Parkman, The J esu ils i η North ,1 met-ica, Introd. xxxvi z ‘⁶ Like other
Indians, the Hurons were desperate gamblers, staking their all, —
ornaments clothing, canoes, pipes, weapons, and wives.'' —vol-
untariam: in contrast to bondage incurred under pressure of some
external agency. as capture in war or infliction of legal penalty.

10. iuvenior: this form occurs only in writers of the Empire.
— adligari: if we may judge from other passages in which¹ this
compound occurs, this word was applied in a technical sense to
fettering the hands and feet of slaves.

12. per commercia: cf. Ayricola 28. 15, per commercia venum· -

datos (servos); 39. 5, emptis per commercia.

As a rule in slave-holding races, intra-tribal slaves are treated
better than extraetribal. In particular, slave debtors, the head
under which the slaves of the class here described, would natu-
rally fall, are treated with lenience‚ being often as little restricted
in their movements and existence as they would be if they were
free agents. Among the Israelites, for example, the native
who had lost his liberty through debt met with far more consid-
eration than slaves of foreign extraction; see Levit. 25. 39 f.

On the other hand, it is easy to see how the relation of master
and slave brought to pass in the way described between two
men who had been social equals, would be a painful and difficult
situation. The transfer of “ servi huius condicionis '⁷ into a
bondage removed from their erstwhile life, and the motives
which, according to Tacitus, actuated their sale, find an instruc-
tive analogy in old Roman practice. That a Roman should be
slave to a fellow-citizen was repugnant to Roman ideas; so
it was that in Tabula 3 of the Laws os the Twelve Tables it was
ordained that, after the third day, the debtor who had been made
over to his creditor should be punished with death or sold abroad,
i.e. trans Tiberim; see Mackenzie, Studies in Roman Law, p. 94.

Slaves and freedmen.

1. ceteris servis: turning from the special type of slave,
whose treatment forms a case apart, to the status of the ordinary
slave population. — descriptis: marked out.
