28 NOTES

7. informem: lit. shapeless, hence here applied to the savage
aspect of an uncultivated land. The Romans had little taste for
the picturesque and the wild in natural scenery.

8. tristem cultu adspectuque: qloomy to dwell in ahd to view.—
nisi si patria sit: an oft-repeated sentiment; cf. Cicero, De Ami-
citia 68: consuetudo valet, cum locis ipsis delectemur, montuosis
etiam et silvestribus, in quibus diutius commorati sumus (‘ famil-
iarity has its effect, in that we find delight in the very country,
mountainous and wooded even though it be, in which we have
sojourned a longer time than usual’); James Montgomery’s

hnes ’ “ Man through all ages of revolving time,

Unchanging man in every varying clime,
Deems his own land of every land the pride,
Beloved of Heaven o’er all the world beside.‘'

9. carminibus antiquis z sagas, or lays dealing with the geneal-
ogies and deeds of heroes, such as preceded prose history writing
among the Greeks and probably among the Romans.-quod
unum . . . annalium genus: in the case of the Britons, Tacitus
was unable to cite explicitly even poetic tradition as to their
origin; cf. Aqricola 11. 2.

10. Tuistonem: i.e. ‘the twofold one ’; compare Ger. zwei,
zwischen; Eng. two. He may have been conceived of as bi-
sexual; an interesting, though not a complete, analogy is
Cecrops, mythical founder of the royal line of Athens, who, as
did Tuisto, sprang from the earth and was portrayed as biformis,
half man and half serpent.

11. Mannum: i.e. ‘ the thinking creature,’ derived from the
root which appears in Gk. μιμνήσκω, Lat. memini, Ger. Menseh,
Eng. man. Mannus was thus the first human being endowed with
the power of thought. There is reason to believe that we have
here the Germanic offshoot of the Indo-European myth of the
creation of man.

12. tris filios: three sons are characteristic of the third
generation in mythical genealogies; thus, Uranus, Cronus, and
Zeus, Poseidon, Pluto; Deucalion (the Greek Noah), Hellen,
and Dorus XuthUS, Aeolus. We may recall in this connection
Shem, Ham, and J apheth, the “ three sons of Noah and of them
