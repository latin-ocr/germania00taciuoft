⁰1. nec cohibere parietibus: grove& stone cairus, and pre-
cincts fenced in by stones but open to the sky, constituted the
Germans’ sanctuaries, to which, however, the word templum in
its literal sense of ‘ sacred inclosure,' may bc applied; cf. chap.
40. 16, where it is a synonym for nemus. The statement of
Tacitus as to the non-existence of temples is confirmed by the
archaeological evidence, but his explanation of the fact is er-
roneous. The absence of temple structures was due not to
philosophical conviction but to the primitive stage of religious
development reached by the Germ-ans. A striking parallel
to this passage is the account of the nature-worshiping Persians, ·
found in Herodotus 1. 131 ; ⁴ The Persians, I am aware, observe
usages of this sort, not deeming it lawful to set up statues,
temples, and shrines3 but they impute folly to such as do these
things, according to my way of thinking, because they do not
believe, as do the Greeks, that the gods have human forms.’ —
in ullam humani oris speciem: a few specimens of wooden
idols, fashioned into a rude semblance of the human form,
have been 'unearthed in Teutonic lands, notably in Denmark.
At present the data do not suffice to show that such anthropo-
morphic representations of gods had developed independently
among the Germans in prehistorie times; they may well be
due to Roman influence. Hence the assertion of Tacitus may
stand, especially in view of the fact that, as appears from the
context, he had in mind chiefly the temple statues of the Roman
gods, with which, of course, there was nothing strictly com-
parable among the Germans.

8. ex: in keepinq with.

9. lucos ac nemora: ‘⁴ the groves were God's first temples ’⁹
(Bryant, A Fores! Hymn). Mention of sacred groves is not
infrequent in Tacitus; thus, chap. 39. 3-4, in silvam . . .
sacram; 40. 8-9, the castum nemus of Nerthus; Annales 2. 12,
i‘n silvam Herculi sacram.

10. secretum illud: that mysterious entity. Compare with
the spirit of this context the words of Tacitus as to the Jews,
Historiae 5. 5: Iudaei mente sola unumque numen intellequnt; pro-
fanos qui deum imaqines mortalibus materiis in species hominum
effinqant (ι the Jews believe in one god, comprehensible to
