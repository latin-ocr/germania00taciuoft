INTRODUCTION To THE mmmmm xvii

modification of the methods os ancient men os letters.
' In the time of Tacitus, treatment, in a separate esmy, os
a country and its inhabitants was not without precedent.
Thus, Seneca, who, as a stylistie model, at least, exerted
influence on Tacitus, had publishecl books on Egypt
and India. Hence the Germania, although it developed
as a result of the literary interests of our author, was
probably framed as a distinct work by him and not
especially designed to hold a formal place in the se-
quence of his program of historical composition.

Our age prides itself on its devotion to scientific ac-
curacy and to information gained at first-hand. No
beauties of style would win a high place in our esteem
for a book on Spanish America—let us say—which
was not based on intimate personal knowledge of the
countries and peoples described. The Germania, how-
ever, is the handiwork of the bookman and the stylist,
and not of the traveler and the explorer. The treatise
contains no convincing indication that Tacitus had ever
visited Germany and studied the land and its inhab-
itants at short range. The literary ideals of his day
would not have exacted such punctiliousness of him in
amassing his material. Deference, of course, was paid
to reliability‚ and artistic merits could not palliate falsi-
fication of data, either in the opinion of Tacitus or of
his reading public. His own uncompromising attitude
in this regard is expressed at the beginning of his account
of Britain (Ayr. 10) and is doubtlcss typical of the most
severe criticism of the time. Here he claims highest
respect for information based on authoritative observa·
tion by others, not on first-hand acquaintance. The
same standards would hold good for the Germania.
