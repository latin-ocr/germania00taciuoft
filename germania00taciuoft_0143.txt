12. non Samnis . . . ne Parthi quidem: only those enemies
that menaced Rome through a considerable period are included —
hence, doubtless. the omission of mention of the invasion of
Pyrrhus. Note the shifts from singular to plural, from name of
people to that of country.

Rome's struggle with the Samnites for ascendancy in Central
Italy was protracted through three wars, the first beginning in
343 13.c., the last ending in 290 13.c. At the battle of the Caudine
Forks, an entire army of Romans was forced to capitulate. So
late as the time of Sulla, the Samnites attempted unsuceessfully
to throw off the yoke of Rome. —non Poeni: especially, of
course, in the conflict with Hannibal, 218-201 acu—Hispaniae:
the subjugation of Spain. to which Rome acquired the title after
the Second Punic War, was marked by a long series of disasters
to the Roman arms; the reverses were due alike to the deter-

Cisalpine Gaul by the Romans. The uprising of the Gauls under
Vercingetorix was the most serious crisis in Caesar’s conquest of
Transalpine Gaul. ’

13. Parthi : the ill-fated expedition of Crassus, which came to
grief in 53 B. c.‚ and the abortive ending of Antony’s attempt at an
invasion of Parthia in 36 13.c., are the outstanding features of the
continued disputes between Rome and the Parthians for the
possession of Syria and Armenia, and the control of the East.
The return (20 Β.ο.) of the standards captured from Crassus
marked only a luu in the protracted clash of interests between
these two traditional foes. — Arsacis: founder and first mon-
