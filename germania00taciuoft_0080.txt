48 NOTEs

3. Martem: πλε. Tiu, originally the lord of the heavens,
akin to Zeus and Jupiter, and chief of all the gods; he gradually
developed into the war god par excellence of the Germans,
hence his identification in the interpretatio Romana with Mars,
proof of which appears in the translation of dies Martis, French
Mardi, into the old Germanic originals of Dtenstaq, Tuesday.
The divine province of Tiu underwent some modification as
the result of the extension among certain races of the functions
of VVodan, who displaced Tiu to a certain extent from supremacy
in the pantheon. As a death god Wodan also tended more and
more, especially among the Scandinavian peoples‚ to usurp a
place as a god of war.——concessis animalibus: with victims
which are pe1·missible,· written from the point of view of Roman
religion which, in the age of Tacitus, would regard human
victims as incestae.

4. Isidi: it is impossible to establish the definite Germanic
counterpart. Evidently the connection of a sacred ship or a
shiplike symbol with the cult ritual of some Teutonic goddess,
suggested to Tacitus or his source the so-called Navigium
Isidis; in the course of this festival, celebrated March 5, a
vessel laden with spices, and consecrated to isis, was launched
on the sea. This rite commemorated the advent of spring
and the opening of navigation. It is possible, but not certain,
that it was a native goddess of productivity to whom the name
Isis is here applied.

5. nisi quod: introducing a qualification of the preceding
statement as in Agyricola 6. 5. — signum ipsum: the very emblem.
——liburnae: see on Agricola 28. 5. It is not the type of the
ship as such that impels Tacitus to regard the cult as an im·-
portation, but simply the fact that the symbol is a ship.

6. religionem: do not render by the English derivative.—
ceterum: indicating a return to the topic of the 'native religion
after the digression concerning a divinity assumed to be an
importation.

This sentence reflects a tendency‚ frequently discernible in
this treatise‚ to exalt German ideals and life above Roman.
Tacitus here ascribes to the Germans of his time a degree of
spiritual refinement and philosophical insight quite beyond them.
