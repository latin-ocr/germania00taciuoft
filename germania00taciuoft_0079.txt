Mercurius is the Roman analoguo of Wodan, partial corre-
spondence in attributes and functions suffiei11g.as is usual in
instances of this sort, to establish identification. Thus the
petasus a-nd the eadm-eus of Mercury were eomparablo to the
broad-brimmed hat and the magio wand of wedam Wodan
was the god of death: the Greek Hermes was a psychopompus
or conductor of souls to the other world. Each god presided
over trade and commerce. The question is debatable as to

which of these analogies especially contributed to the iden· -

tification‚ clear evidence of which still survives in the corre-
spondence of English Weclnesday, derived from the Woclanstaq
of certain German tribes, with the French Mercredi (dies Μεν-
curii).

T'acitus writes as though Wodan were the chief divinity of
the whole German race. As a matter of fact, his cult had no
such universal currency; his worship flourished especially
among the*peoples who dwelt near the Rhine and Tacitus
generalized from this fact. — certis diebus: at stated sesliinzls.

2. humanis quoque hostiis: the custom of human sacrifice,
characteristic of the lower stages of religious development and
surviving even in more enlightened epochs‚ was by no means
so restricted among the Germans as the words of Tacitus in
this passage would indicate. Wodan. as the god of death,
was a favored recipient of human victims offered as a prophylactic
measure by those whose lives were, or might be, in jeopardy.
However‚ in his case the practice was not limited to fixed oc-
casions, and, furthermore‚ it was a feature of other eults, (κῃ.
that of the sovereign god of the Suebi, that of Nerthus (cf.
chap. 39 and 40), and of Tiu, the war g0‹1; cf. Annales 13. 57.
where it is related that the Hermunduri immolated the defeated
army of the Chatti to Tiu and Wodan. Human sacrifice was
resorted to also in times of famine and to avert the perils of the
sea: instances of the persistence of the rite among Teutonic
races are found throughout the first ten centuries of our era
and even beyond.—Hercu1em: i.e. Donar; cf. note on chap.
