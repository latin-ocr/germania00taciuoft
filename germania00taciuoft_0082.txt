Chapter 10.

Methods of divination.

1. auspicia sortesque: the former is the broader term and
includes the several methods of divination mentioned in the
chapter exclusive of the lot. Recall Caesar, Bellum Gallicum
1. 50. 4 (quoted in note on 8. 7), where we are told that the
German matrons resorted to the lot in order to discover the
propitious time for battle; also 1. 53. 7, in which it is narrated
that the Germans had recourse to the lots three times to deter-
mine the fate of Valerius Procillus, a friend of Caesar held
captive by Ariovistus. — ut qui maxime: elliptical for ut ii qui
maxime observant. — sortium: divination by lot was so wide-
spread as to amount to a folk custom in antiquity. The prac-
tice existed among pcoples so far separated as Scythians, Celts,
Italiam, Finns‚ and Teutons. Among the Italians Caere,
Falerii, and Patavium were centers of the process and the
sortes of the temple of Fortune at Praeneste were especially
famous. Cicero, De Divinatione 2. 41. 85—87, flouts the method
as a tissue of fraud; nevertheless the sortileyus continued to
be a feature of the life of Augustan and imperial Rome3 cf.
Horace, Satires 1. 9. 29 f.; Tibullus, 1. 3. 11-12; Juvenal,
6. 583; Apuleius, Metamorphoses 9. 8.

2. simplex: ‘conform—virgam: wood, since it was most
readily obtainable and easily incised, was the material most
used for the sortes among primitive peoples. In Italy as well,
the wooden lot seems 130Α have been the sanctioned type in gen-
eral: Plautus, Casina 384, refers to those made of poplar or
fir wood; the lots used at Praeneste were made of oak; cf.
Cicero's description, De Divinatione 2. 41. 85: declarant . . .
perfracto soro sortis erupisse in robore insculptas priscarum
litterarum notis (‘ they assert . . . that, when the rock had
been cleft, there burst from it lots composed of the characters
of an archa-ic alphabet incised on oak wood '). However‚
interesting specimens of bronze sortes have been found3 see
