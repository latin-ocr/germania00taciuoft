XX INTRODUCTION TO THE GERMANIA ‚

Although, as has been said, the Germania was essen-
tially the creation of a litterateur, it was not merely a
compilation based on the work of authors of past genera-
tions. The occurrence in various passages of adverbial
expressions such as hodie and adhuc (chap. 3), nunc (chaps.
33, 36, 37, 41), mox limite acto (chap. 29), proximis tem-
poribus (chap. 37), and the like, shows that he took cog-
nizancc of events and conditions of his own day. He
was informed as to recent shifts in tribal positions and
changes of the frontier. His discussion of the tribes
of the far north and of the eastern Germans bears, so
far as our means of comparison extend, marks of greater
originality and less dependence on literary sources than
does his treatment of the peoples of southern and west-
ern Germany. Now, there was no lack of informants
to whom he might apply for a knowledge of such con-
temporary affairs as had not been incorporated in books.
Between the City and Germany there was a constant
circulation of persons bound on military and official
missions or engaged in mercantile pursujts. In the
social stratum of Tacitus there were, of a certainty, many
who had seen service along the Rhine and the Danube
and had come into close touch with German life and
affairs. The letters of his friend Pliny bear witness
to the pains Tacitus took -to secure data possessed by
persona] observers, when opportunity offered, in the
composition of his purely historical‘workss We may be
assured that the Germania contains the results of oral
or epistolary inquiries directed to qualified informants,
since this procedure is in accord with his literary method
as we find it exemplified elsewhere.
