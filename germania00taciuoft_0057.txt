NOTES

Chffrt’ffi‘bssundaries of Germany ; the courses of the Rhiue and the

Danube.

1. Germania omnis: Germany as (ι whole: Tacitus vehor-s the
opening words of Caesar's Bellum Gallicum. German)- proper
is here considered as a geographical unit apart from the Roman
provinces of Upper and Lower Germany, which were situated ,
on the left bank of the Rhine.— Raetisque et Pannoniis: these
nouus, connected by et, stand in close relation as the second
member of the coordinate series. The Raeti inhabited Eastern
Switzerland, the Tyrol, and Southern Bavaria.

The western boundary of Pannonia lay somewhat to the west
of Vienna; on the north and the east the province was bordered
by the Danube. Between Raetia and Pannonia lay Noricum,
which Tacitus here leaves unmentioned.

2. Sarmatis: peoples containing Slavic elements and also
possessing racial affinity with the Medes and Persians3 their
domain in general comprised the steppes of Russia north of the
Black Sea and the Caucasus Mountains. One tribe, the Iazyges,
occupied at this time that part of Hungary that lies between
the Danube and the Theiss. — Dacisque ε a Thracian stock which,
a decade before the Germania was written, had inflicted severe
defeats on the armies of Domitiam Transylvania and adjacent
regions were included in Dacian territory.-mutuo metu aut
montibus: a striking example of the combination of concrete
and abstract ideas; cf. the note on Ayricola 25. 8. This usage is
favored especially by Tacitus and the poets of the Empire;
one of the earliest instances in Latin is Plautus, Rudens 436:
nostro illum puteum periclo cl ferramentis fodimus (‘ Ι dug that
well with peril to myself and with iron tools '). The mountains
referred to are the Carpathians.

3. oceanus: the North Sea and the Baltic.—sinus: used
here, as in Aqricola 23. 6 and Germania 37. l, in the sense of a

‘ projection of the land!
