Neres 35

is the standing word of description applied in Latin to the color
of the eyes of the Germaus; cs. Horace, Ia'podes 16. 7 and Juvenal,
Satires 13. 164.

6. rutilae comae: the same characteristic is attributed ιο the
Caledoniam, Aqricola ll. 4. — magna corpora: ef. styra-ola ll. 4 ;
Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1. 39. l z iuqcnti tnaynicudtne corporum
Germanos. The large frames of the (lauls aud the (lermans were
always a source of wonder to the shorter‚ more stoc-ky Romans.
—tantum ad impetum valida: in Annales 23. 14 Germanicus is
represented as encouraging his soldiers before a battle with the

assurance: iam corp us ((ὴηᾞιαηονιιηι) ιι( visa torvum et ad brevem >

impetum validum, sic nulla vulnerum patientia et seq. (⁴ moreover,
the (German) physique, while grim to behold and powcrful in a
brief onset, has no capability in enduring wounds ’).

7. non eadem: not on α par with their aggressiveness.

8.‘ aestumque tolerare: in Historiae 2. 93 we are told that the
heat of the Roman summer, and a reckless reeourse ιο the waters
of the Tiber, played havoc with the health of the German and
Gallie troop's of Vitellius. —frigora atque inediam: the force of
tolerare is continued with these words ; note the chiastic arrange-
ment with reference to the preceding pair. The asyndeton con-
ceals an adversative conjunctim, as in Aqrz'cola 12. 18: tarde
mitescunt, cito proveniunt.

9. caelo solove: causal ablatives. These words dexterously
mark the transition to the description of the country and the
products with which the next chapter begins.

Chapter 5.

The country and its products3 the precious metals and the
valuation attached to them.

1. aliquanto: to some extent.

2. silvis: according to Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 6. 25, the
Hercynian Forest was nine days' journey in width and so long
that a march of sixty days would not bring a travelcr to its
furthest borders. Other forests were the Teutoburgiensis,
Bacensis‚ and Caesia. — paludibus: the typical description of
the German terrain always contains reference to the marshes:
e-g. Historiae 4. 73: eadem semper causa Germanis transcendendi
