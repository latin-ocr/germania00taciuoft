Chapter 36.

The Cherusci.

1. in latere : 220. on the east. —- Cherusci: when at the height
of its power, in the first two decades of the first century A.D.‚
the nation of the Cherusci occupied the territory north of the
Hartz Mts. between the Elbe and the Weser, and reached to the
west beyond the latter river. At the time of Tacitus the Chatti
