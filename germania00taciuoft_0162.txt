from the root which appears in this word. —— inter vada atque in
ipso litore: from the Stone Age to tho present day the Prussian
coast has been famed for its amber. In the time of Tacitus
Samland, north of Konigsberg in East Prussia‚ had practically a
monopoly of this commodity and is still the chief source of the
world’s supply; Dantzig is the principal depot of the trade.

Amber is still gathered on the coast by searchers who are
equipped with nets attached to long poles, and who ransack the
shallows at low tide. Dredging operations and divers are also
employed. Amber is likewise found in pit deposits at some
distance from the sea and is in this case obtained by mining
processes. ⁸

17. ut barbaris: as would naturally be the case among] barba-
rians; cf. Ayrz'cola 11. 2, ut inter barbaros.

18. luxuria nostra: as a matter of fact, however, amber was
¹prized at very early periods of civilization. In the Stone Age
amber ornaments were the favorite articles of personal adornment‚
as the graves of the period testify. In the Bronze Age amber
ceased to be so highly favored among the northern peoples‚ who
had learned to know bronze and gold, but it became an article
of commerce and was spread by various trade routes over
Mediterranean and Western Europe, where it was eagerly wel-
comed. Objects of amber have been found in the Mycenaean
tombs of Greece, in the lake dwellings of Italy, and even among
relics of the Bronze Age 111 England.

Of these facts Tacitus, of course, had no knowledge, so con-
fines himself to mentioning amber as an article of Roman luxury,
in which 11 began to have a place in the late Republio and the
early Empire. Great quantities of it were brought to Romein
the principate of Nero to be used in enhancing the magnificence
of a gladiatorial exhibition; cf. Pliny, Naturalis Historia 37. 3.
