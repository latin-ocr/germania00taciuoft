Chapter 7.

Military leaders, their choice and the extent of their powers;
incentives to valor in battle.

1. reges: among the tribes of Germany supreme power was
vested sometimes in one person, called by Tacitus the rex, some-
times in two or more principes. Rea: and principes alike were
scions of the family or families which, by virtue of ancient lineage,
formed the top of the social structure of the tribe. Such
preeminence was due ordinarily to a supposed divine origin.
The king, where he existed, was that one of the principes in
whose hands authority was centralized by popular choice.
Eligibility only was hereditary; final option rested with the
people.

As is shown by the case of the Cherusci, who, in the year 47 A.1›.
with the consent of the emperor Claudius, set up as king Italicus,
the sole surviving member of the reqic stirps, although in previous
years they had been ruled by principes, monarchy and oligarchy
might interchange in one tribe. However‚ in general the peoples
of East Germany inclined to a single ruler, whereas in the West
control was commonly in the hands of principes. — ex nobilitate :
on the ground os noble lineaye. — duces: called in Old High Ger-
man herzoqa, modern German, H erzoq. Among tribes that had no
king, the natural leader in war where he existed, a dux was chosen
to exercise chief command3 such tribal duces were Brinno among
the Canninefates (Historiae 4. 15), GannascuS, chosen dux by
the Chauci though himself a member of the Canninefates (Annales
11. 8). As in the cases of Ariovistus, Arminius, the conqueror of
Varus, and Civilis, leader of the revolt of 69-70 A.D., a dua: might
head a confederation of several tribes. The selection of a dux was
indicated by carrying him on an upraised shield, a ceremony
which was perpetuated in the choice of a king among the later
Goths and Franks. — nec . . . infinita . . . potestas: the
German kings, owing as they did their position to popular choice,
were inevitably limited in initiative and remained the instruments
of the tribal will as expressed in the folk assembly.

2. exemplo: ablative of means, explained by the following
clause.
