1. 1. 10; 2. 6. 34; Juvenal, Satires 5. 19—23.

2. saepius calida: sc. quam aqua sriqida. The language of
Tacitus does not forbid the reader to assume that, at least at
certain seasons of the year, the Germans resorted to bathing in
the rivers. Hence there is no essential variance with Caesar’s
account, Bellum Gallicum 4. 1.10: ut srtqidissimz's locis . . .
(Suebi) lavarentur in fluminibus; 6. 21. 5; (Germani) . . . pro-

9. 1. 3; Suetonius, Caliqala 45; Tacitus, Historiae 2. 68.
The comment of Horace, Satires 1. 4. 51 f.‚ on conviviality by

(filius) et ‘magnam quod dedecus ambulet ante noctem cum facibus,
et seq. (⁴ But the wrathful father storms because . . . his
