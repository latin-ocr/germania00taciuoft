in Galliam . . . ut relictis paladibus et solitudinibus suis secundis-
simam hoc solum . . . possiderent (‘ an always invariable reason
movod the Germane to cross into Gaul . . . (the desire) to leave
behind their native swamps and wildernesses and occupy this
highly fertile soil '). — umidior qua Gallias: not primarily a
direct allusion to a heavier rainfalL but to the swampy nature of
the country in West Germany and Holland‚ the scenes of most
of the Roman campaigns in Germany in the first century ΑΛ).
Cf. Tacitus, Annales 1. 61, umido paladmm 1. 68, egressos . . .
per umida el impedita ‚· 2. 23, amidis Germaniae terris.

3. ventosior: contrasted With umidior, since the prevalence of
winds would make for a drier country—adspicit: cf. Aqricola
24. 3-4: eamque partem Britanniae quae Hiberniam adspicit.—
satis: ablative.

4. frugiferarum arborum inpatiens: written from the point
of view of one familiar with the opposite conditions existing in
Italy. Total absence of fruit trees is not implied but only of their ἒ
cultivation3 hence there is no inconsistency involved in the
mention of aqrestia poma in chap. 23. 3.

5. improcera: supply sunt pecora. — armentis: horned cattle.
— suus honor: their qeneric attractione, referring especially to
size and appearance.

seen on Italian cattle to this day. — numero: instead of in fine
breeds. — solae et gratissimae opes: solae is a somewhat ex-
aggerated statement; gyratis-simae is more exact. In certain
Old Germanic languages the same word signified ‘ cattle ‘ and
‘ wealth ’; similarly, in Latin, pecunia is connected etymologi-
cally with pecus. In the Homeric poems values are sometimes
expressed ln terms of cattle, c. 9. Iliad 2. 449 and 6. 236 ἑκατόμβοιος,
Odisssezj 1. 431 ἐεικοσάβοιος.

’7. propitii: the sentiment that “money is the root of all
