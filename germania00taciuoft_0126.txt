11. Germanorum natione: not said with reference to ethnic
origin -— we learn in chap. 43 that the Osi were Pannonians —-
but with reference to geographica] situation, the lands north
of the Danube being included by Tacitus in Germania,· see
chap. 1.

13. incertum est: since the seat of the Pannonian races, of
which the Aravisci and the Osi were brancheS‚ was south of
the Danube, it is more likely that the Osi were the emigrants.
In any case the assumption must be based on inference rather
than on ethnological data.

14. eadem . . . bona malaque erant: recall the principle
correctly assumed in chap. 2, that trend of migration is affected
by the natural advantages possessed by one country over another.
Here political conditions are likewise predicated as exerting an
influence.

15. Treveri: here begins the treatment of the topic proper,
German migration into Gaul. Note that Tacitus here merely
quotes the claim of the Treveri and the Nervii to Germanic
origin and makes no attempt to support it. In Historiae 4. 73
the Treveri are definitely included with the Gauls. As a matter
of fact, both peoples were true Celtic nationalities, although they
had received accessions of Germanic blood from the assimilation
of Teutonic invaders. The Treveri, the most prosperous and
flourishing people of the Belgae, lived in the valley of the Moselle.
The name of their capital, Auyusta Treverorum, survives in the
modern Treves or Trier‚ situated in Rhenish Prussia not far from
the bordei· of Luxemburg. — Nervii : Caesar’s famous foes; they
dwelt west of the Sambre and were backward in culture as com-
pared with the Treveri. — cirea: in reqard to, a meaning of this
preposition frequently *found in the writers of the Empire.

16. ultro ambitiosi: pretentious to α deyree.

18. haud dubie: joined to Germanorum attributively.

19. Vangiones, Triboci, Nemetes: th'ese three tribes occupied
the territory on the west bank of the Rhine but not in the order
named. The Vangiones were in the vicinjty of Worms‚ the
Triboci near Strassburg and the Vosges, while between them,
near Speyer‚ were the Nemetes. All three fought on the side
of Ariovistus against Caesar: cf. Bellum Gallicum 1. 51. 2. -
