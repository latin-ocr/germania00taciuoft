2. familiam: {he staff os slaves belonging to an establishment.
The complexim· of Roman private life naturally called for a spe-
cialization of functions as between the familia urbana and the
familia rustica and within these two groups, especially the
formcr; see Sandys, A Companion to Latin Studies, Art. 539.
—suam . . . sedem . . . regit: an analogous arrangement
was in vogue in Italy, where, for a consideration in money or
produce, a slave might hold and work a parcel of land, but only
on sufferance of the master. Tityrus, in the Firsl Ecloque of
Vergil, is such a slave tenant. However, those to whom Tacitus
here, in want of a better word, applies the generic term servi,
were a grade above the Italian slave farmer. They were ac-
tually held in serfdom or villeinage‚ the condition into whjch in
later times slavery in Europe was transformed. Such serfs
were bound to the soil and liable to requisition in labor 01·
produce, but preserved their personal freedom.

4. ut colono 2 the coloni, or free tenant farmers, were the class
on which the great landowners of the Empire mainly depended
for working their estates; see, e.9.‚ Pliny, Epistulae 9. 37. The
tenant leased a parcel of land on shares (colonus partiarius) —
herein lies the point of resemblance with the German serf -- or
for a money rental (colonus qui ad pecuniam numeratam conduxit).
—— hactenus paret: ef. Aqrz'cola 10. 19, hactenus iussum. In
order to throw into relief the harshness of Roman slavery, Taci-
tus has painted the lot of the German slave in too bright colors3
he treats the tenant serf as the typical slave and probably under-
states his disabilities. Furthermore, as modern ethnological
parallels show, the conditions of slavery would not have been
the same throughout all Germany‚ but would have varied greatly
among separate tribeS, according to their economjc position and
mode of life.

5. cetera domus officia: the other services, those of the house-
hold. The implication contained in this sentence, to the effect
that the Germans did not have household slaves, is at odds with
Tacitus's own statement in ehap. 20. 4 and with linguistic
evidence, from which it appears that various German words
for ⁴ slavess ‘ servitor,‘ like Greek οἰκέτης παῖς, Latin puer,
denote also ‘member of the household,’ ‘b0y‚’ ‘girL’ et cet. We
