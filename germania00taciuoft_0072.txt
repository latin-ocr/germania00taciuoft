40 NOTEs

contrast with variare qyros. -— dextros: the language of Tacitus
should not be so pressed as to lead to the inference that the Ger-
man cavalry could not execute a left wheel but that they ordina-
rily did not. The point which Tacitus wished to emphasize is
that the Germans were not trained to match the mobility which
enabled a troop of Roman horsemen suddenly to shift from a
turn in one direction into a turn in the other without breaking
the alignment. In the case of a German column, a wheel begun
in one direction was always completed. The right wheel alone
is specified because it is the one which would more naturally
occur to the mind as an example; furthermore, this evolution
would be resorted to more commonly, since the side protected
by the shield would be thus presented to the foe.

13. coniuncto orbe: not a very lucid expression, because it
was actually the horsemen who were coniuncti, orbe being the
circle or the arc of the circle of which the file of wheeling troops
was the radius. Translate: the wheelinq file preservinq its
aliynment. —in universum aestimanti: the same phrase occurs
in Ayricola 11. 10.

14. plus . . . roboris: cf. Ayricola 12. 1, in pedite robur; Germa-
nia 30. 12, omne robur (Chattorum) in pedite. — eoque: = ideoque.
The mode of fighting practiced by these combined forces is de-
scribed in detail by Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1. 48. We should
infer from his account that each contingent contained an equal
number of horse and foot, each cavalryman choosing his comrade
from the infantry. The foot soldiers supported the horsemen in
action and came to their rescue· in case they were unhorsed.
Caesar himself recognized the servieeabiljty of such troops and
utilized thern in the war with Vercingetorix'(cf. Bellum Gallicum
7. 65. 4—5) and in the Pharsalian campaign; cf. Bellum Civile
3. 75 and 84.

15. congruente velocitate: cf. Bellum Gallicum 1. 48. 7:
si quo erat lonyius prodeundum aut celerius recipiendum, tanta
erat horum exercitatione celeritas, ut iubis sublevati equorum
cursum adaequemur.

16. ante aciem locant: not, of course, alone, but with their
equestrian companions‚ whose presence in the same place follows
as a matter of course.
