In later times, they were merged with other races under the
appellation Alamanni: however, they did not lose their original
ethnic identity as Suebi, for it is from them that modern Suabia,
once a part of the domain of the Alamanni, received its name.

2. stato tempore: at a stamlz'nq ses-tal season, not necessarily
of annual recurrence.

3. silvam . . . sacram: cf. 9. 9, lacos ac nemora consecrant.
—auguriis patrum et prisca formidine sacram: these words
form a complete hexameter. Tacitus doubtless slipped into the
rhythm unconsciously; similar lapses —for so ancient stylists
considered them— occur semi-occasionally elsewhere in Latin
prose writers. The first clause in Livy⁷s preface to his history
forms part of a hexameter and in Book 22. 50 the words haec ubi
dicta dedit, strinyit yladium cuneoquesacto per medios are a hexam-
eter and a half. The diction here has a poetic color, com-
parable to Vergil, Aeneid 7.172, (tectum) horrendum silvis et
reliqione parentum, and this fact rendered it easy for Tacitus
to glide into a rhythmic cadence. The ablatives are causal;

4. eiusdem sanguinis: i.e. Sueborum.

5. publice: in the name os the association. On human sacrifice
among the Germans‚ see note on 9. 2.

6. horrenda primordia: qrucsome introductory ceremonies.

7. nisi vinculo ligatus: the interpretation given by Tacitus
of the inner significance of this usage is correct. Cords and
bonds figure not infrequently in ritual and religion as symbols
of the subjection of a devotee to a deity. The fillet used in
Greek and Roman worship was in origin a badge of devotion
and consecration to a higher power. See on the subject, Bonner,
The Sacred Bond, American l’hz‘loloyical Association, Transac-
tions and Proceedinqs‚ 44 (1913), esp. p. 239.—minor: an
inseri0r; cf. Horace, Epistulae 1. 1. 106, sapiens uno minor est
Iove (‘ the philosopher is inferior to Jove alone ').

8. prae se ferens: yiviny open testimony to. Cf. Ayricoza
43. 14, speciem doloris . . . prae se tulit. — attolli: reflexive in
meaning, as is also evolvuntur below. The notion underlying
the observance was doubtless that a fall was due to the visita-
tion of providence and that he whom the god had cast down
