Chapter 23.

Food and drink.
1. potui umor ex hordeo: becr; cf. the οῖνος κρίθινος of the
ancient Armeniam. Xenophon, Artaba-sis 4. 5. 26, and Vergil‘s

allusion to the national beverage of the northern peoples, Georyics
3. 379-380:

hic noctem lado ducant et pocula laeti
fermento (yeast or fermented grain) atque
acidis imitantur vitea sorbis.

—frumento: i.e. wheat, in practice the usual connotation of

' frumentum, since this was the grain ordinarily served out as -

rations in the Roman armies and given in doles to the citizens.
—in . . . similitudinem vini: cf. Vergil's pocula imitantur vitea.

2. proximi ripae ε this same expression is used in chap. 17. 5-6.
- vinum mercantur: Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 4. 2. 6, writes of
the Suebi of his time : vinam omnino ad se importari non patiuntur
quod ea re ad laborem serendam remollescere homines atque effemi-
nari arbitrantur. The German words relating to the culture of
the grape and the manufacture of wine are mostly Latin deriva-
tives: e.9. Wein, vinum‚· Most, mastum; Keller, cellarium, et cet.

3. poma: not only the fruits of trees, such as apples, pears,
and the like, but also berries and nuts. There is no equally
comprehensive word in English. — reeens: the Romans shared
the predjlection of the modern palate for meat rendered tender
by ‘⁴ hanging ” and even tended to carry the appreciation of a
gamey flavor to extremes.

4. lac concretum: curdS, clotted eream, et cet.; on the menu
of the ancient Germans cf. also Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 6. 22. 1 :
maior pars eoram victas in lacte, casea, carne consistit. — blandi-
mentis: whets and sauces such as figured extensively in the
Roman bill of fare; note the list in Horace, Satires 2. 8. 8-9;

rapula, lactucae, radices, qualia lassum
pervellunt stomachum, siser, allec, saecula Coa

(‘rapes, lettuce, radishes, such condiments as stimulate the
jaded stomach, skirret, fish-pickle‚ tartar-lees of Coan wine ’).

7. haud minus facile . . . vincentur: this sentence was ob-
viously written to bring the chapter to an epigrammatic close,
