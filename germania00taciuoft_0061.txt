Around each of the thrce centercd a cult gronp consisting ol'
peoples supposedly united by ties of relationship in their common
deseent from the heroic forefather. In the process ol' religious
development the worship of some one of the chief gods of the
German pantheon became dominant among the tribes composing

each of the three groups, although not necessarily restricted to λ

the group or adopted by all the tribes in it. Thus the cults of
Foeyr and Tiu flourished especially among the Ingaevones and
the Herminones respectively; the worship of Wodan had its
center in the regions occupied by the Istaevones. In each case
the original eponymous hero tended to merge with the personality
of the greater divinity and the name of the progenitor to become
an epithet of the god.

This classification into three races does not pretend to be com-
plete and is not utilized by Tacitus in his detailed discussion of
German ethnology, chap. 28 and following. Hence it should
not be assumed that he meant to imply that these three groups
included all the peoples of Germany. He is concerned here
chiefly with the mythical genealogy of the Germans and so
singles out for mention these three divisions as being those which,
according to the tradition of the Germans themselves, preserved
in their names proof of origin from the sons of Mannus, the com-
mon ancestor. Therefore he deemed it necessary to locate them
only roughiy. As a matter of fact, this classification applies
only to the peoples west of the Oder. Pliny, Natural History
4. (28). 99, gives a more comprehensive, though not exhaustive,
division of the races of Germany‚ in which he adds to the three
groups here mentioned the Vandili of Northeastern Germany
and the Peucini along the eastern border.

13. Ingaevones: Pliny's transcription, Inqvaeones, is closer
to the original German than the spelling of Tacitus, which has
been modified to suit Roman vocal organs. Modern scholars
, differ as to the transliteration of all three names.
