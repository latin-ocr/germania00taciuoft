apparel of the masseS. at least in severe weather. Even a primi-
tive people suits its eostume to the elimate. Those Germans
who could not afford or obtain eloth. substituted skins, and
since this undoubtedly included the majority of the population‚
Caesar’s generalization, referred to above, had some justifica-
tion.—-non fluitante: referring not so much to the flowing
garments in general characteristio of Oriental garb as to the
loose trousers, anaxyrides, which, in the eyes of the Greeks· and
the Romans, formed the outstanding feature of the eostume
of the Eastern peoples.

5. gerunt: se. Germani.

6. neglegenter . . . exquisitius: among the peoples who
dwelt near the Rhine and the Danube and had become familiar
with civilized garb, skins were no longer highly esteemed as
articles of apparel, hence those who wore them were eareless in
their'ehoiee. Tribes that lived apart from the zone of Roman
influenoe and trade were discriminating.

⁷. cultus: finery.—velamina: a poetic word, ehosen not
only because of our author’s partiality for novel locutions but
also because it ean be applied alike to the skins and to the gar-
ments made from them. Our English word “ vestures '’ might
suggest the stylistio effect.

8. spargunt: Vergil, Ecloyues 2. 41, writes of the dappled roe:
capreoli sparsis etiam nunc pellibus albo (⁴ roes with their skins
even now dappled with white '). — maculis pellibusque: hen-
diadys for maculis pellium. Pieees eut from the skins of animals
not native to Germany were attaeh‘ed to the. original pelt; being
different from it in color, these patehes are called maculae. —
beluarum: we may conjecture that seals were among the
am'mals here alluded to; the ideas of Tacitus as to the genus
and speeies of his beluae were probably vague enough.

9. Oceanus atque ignotum mare: as in chap. 2. 4 f.‚ adver·
sus Oceanus . . . praeter periculum . . . iqnoli maris, the far
reanhes of the mysterious Northern Oeean, the mare piyrum
et qrave of Agricola 10. 20, are doubtless meant. —-nec alius
feminis quam viris habitus: this is also true of the Eskimo.

10. saepius: rather frequently. —— lineis amictibus: taking
the place of the woolen saqum as outer garment.
