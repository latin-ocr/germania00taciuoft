NOTES 109

nants of the Cimbri just north of the mouth of the Elbo, in modern
Schleswig-Holstein, or in Northcrn Jutland, where other ancient
writers definitely placed them and where, to this day, the names
of the districta Hilnmerland (Cimbri) and Thythaesyssel (Teu-
toni), perhaps furnish philological evidence of the presence in
olden times of the two peoples, At all events the Cimbri gave
their name to the peninsula of -Jutland, called by ancient writers ,
Cimbrorum chersonesus or promunturium.

2. parva nunc civitas: descendants of a section of the Cimbri
which did not join in the great migration. Cimbri are also men-
tioned as denizens of the ‘⁶ farthest east '’ in these regions in the
time of Augustus, and, together with neighboring tribes, as suing
for the friendship of R0me; cf. Res qestae divi Auqusti (a great
inscription found at Ancyra) 5. 14—15.— gloria: probably an
ablative of specification, balancing a spatio implied with parva.
It may, however, be explained as a nominative.

3. utraque ripa: ripa, without further definition, refers in
Tacitus generally to the Rhine, but also to the Danube according
to the context ; cf. Ayricola 41. 6 f. ε tot exercitus in Moesia Dacia-
que et Germania et Pannonia . . . amissi . . . nec iam de limite
imperii et ripa (Danuvii) . . . dubitatum. Although the Cimbri
had wandered along the Danube during several years prior to
113 B.c.‚ the date of their first contact with Roman forces, during
the period in which they chiefly menaced Rome their movements
were in the west. Hence it is probably the Rhine, ordinarily
regarded as the boundary par ezcellence between Roman and
German lands‚ of which Tacitus was thinking; cf. Aqricola
15. 14-15: sic Germanias caussis-se iqum, et flumine, non Oceano
desendi; Velleius paterculus, 2. 8: tum Cimbri et Teutoni tran-
scendere Rhenum. — castra ac spatia: encampment areos. The
identification of these abandoned fortified sites with camps con—
structed by the Cimbri rested probably on tradition rather than
on exact information. Whethcr such a migratory horde would
take pains to protect itself by bivouacs so durable as to be visible
two centuries later, is questionable. Certainly they would not
intrench themselves each night, after the thoroughgoing custom
of the Romans In the case of the Chatti in the time of Tacitus,

vallare noctem is emphasized as a practice exceptional among the
Germans; cf. 30. 9.
