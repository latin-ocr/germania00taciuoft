46 NOTEs

11. nec tamquam facerent deas: on the surface this context
expresses the fact that, in contrast with the simple reverence
paid to prophetesses in earlier times, a later generation tended
to exalt mystically endowed women into the standing of divini-
ties; cf. Veledam . . . numinis loco habitam l. 9 and also His-
toriae 4. 61. Α Roman reader would inevitably see in the
sentence a satirical thrust at the deification of the unfit among
the women of the imperial houses, (aq. Poppaea Sabina, wife
of Nero, and their daughter, who died in early infancy. Trans-

Chapter 9.

The chief divinities of the German pantheon.

1. deorum maxime Mercurium colunt: perhaps an echo of
the sentence of Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 6. 17. 1, deorum mazime
Mercurium colunt, in which, however, it is the chief divinity
of the Gauls that is identified with Mercury. Caesar's asser-
tion, Bellum Gallicam 6. 21. 2, that the Germans worshiped
oniy the visible and beneficent phenomena of nature, such as
the Sun, Moon, and Fire, and knew nothing of other gods, is
widely at variance with the account of Tacitus and is based
on insufficient knowledge. Worship of the powers of nature,
universal among Indo-Europeans at one time, undoubtedly
survived to some extent· among the Germans of the first cen-
tury B.c.; vestiges of sun worship are most readily traceable.
Nevertheless, even at that period, anthropomorphic cults,
