2. insulam Rheni: before the time of Caesar, the Batavi had
established themselves on the island formed by the Old thne,
tho Waal, and the Maas. — Chattorum quondam populus: the
origin of the Batavi and their expulsion from their native haunts
are referred to in similar terms in Historiae 4. 12. On the Chatti
see Germania 30. 1.

5. insigne: tolcen.

6. tributis contemnuntur: they do not suffer the slight os taxa-
tion.

7. conlationibus: theoretically‚ voluntary contributions‚ but
sometimes extorted under duress, as, effi, by Nero after the Fire;
conlalc'onz'busqne non receptis modo verum efflayitatis provincias
primtornmqne census prope exhausit (⁴ as a result of the contri-
butions which he not only received but even demanded, he
nearly ruined the provinces and drained the fortunes of indi-
viduals ⁹) Suetonius, Nero 38. — in usum proeliorum sepositi:
for a similar use of seponere as applied to choice troops, cf.
Agricola 31. 23: ostendamus quos sibi Caledonia viros seposuerit.
The Batavi were expert cavalrymen and swimmers‚ and were in
demand as members of the imperial body-guard.

9. Mattiacorum gens: they lived across the Rhine from
Mainz, in the vicinity of the modern Wiesbaden. Their name
perhaps survives in Metze‚ southwest of Kassel. — protulit
enim magnitudo populi Romani : most critics see in this sentence
an allusion to the extension and the fortification of the Roman
frontier in Germany carried out by Domitian (see note on limite
octo below), whose name Tacitus, true to his detestation of that
emperor, has suppressed.

However, the locution is quite in the usual manner of Tacitus3
cf. Ayricola 23. 2 ε si . Romani nominis gloria pateretur, inven-
tus in ipso Britannia terminus. Secondly, the country of the
Mattiaci, famed for its silver deposits and its medicinal springs,
had been brought into the sphere of Roman domination by Drusus
and Germanicus and had remained under the control of the Em-
pire except during the revolt of Civilis. It may well be that
it is to the original occupatiori of the country of the Mattiaci
in the Early Empire that Tacitus here refers.

10. veteres terminos: the Rhine.
