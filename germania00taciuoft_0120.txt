defined areas and private holdings; Bellum Gallicum 4. 1. 7;
(3. 22. 2.

4. seeundum dignationem: on the basis os rank; when the
land was parcelcd out among individuale, chieftains and nobles
would receive greater acreage or a choicer plot than those below
them in the social scale. This again is at variance with Caesar,
who implios (6. 22. 4) that all shared alike: cum suas quisque
opes cum potentissimis aequari videat.

52 camporum spatia: the large extent of territory held by a
community assured the satisfaction of all accredjted claimants
of a share. - arva per annos mutant: arvum is land actually
put under cultivation as opposed to σθεν, arable land. It is
hardly possible to understand arva as referring to the whole
tract of plowland taken up by the communjty‚ as does a recent
critic, and to conclude that this sentence develops the thought
of the preceding (tyri . . . occupantur, per annos elucidating
in vices. The idea contained in per annos could easily have
been included at the outset and this would have been in the
manner of Tacitus, who is prone to avoid wasting words. Fur-
thermore‚ the thought of the two clauses directly preceding the
sentence relates exclusively to the assignments turned over to
individuals and it is natm-al to suppose that this subject is
continued. We may interpret thus: each year the husband-
man worked a different piece in his apportioned plot and per-
mitted the rest to lie fallow; this practice was made possible
by the size of each individual's share and was naturally resorted
to because of ignorance of what manure, abundant enough among
them (see c. 5. 4 ; 16. 12), could have accomplished for the enrich-
ment of the soil.

6. nec enim . . . labore contendunt: introducing a contrast be-
tween the simple and wasteful methods of German husbandry and
the intensive and diversified operations of Italian agriculture and
horticulture. Translate : sor they do not by work compete, i.e. their
methods do not measure up to their opportunjties. The German
words for fruits and vegetables are mostly of foreign origin, a
fact which goes to show that these articles were not indigenous.

8. seges: φαίη. —imperaturz the crop is, as it were, a trib-
ute requisitioned by the farmer from his subject, the soil.
