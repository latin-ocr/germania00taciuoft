Marriage customs.

1. quamquam: and ψει,- the apparent lack of modesty in
costume was not accompam'ed by moral laxity.

4. non libidine: by anticipation of the following clause, the
polygamy is viewed as consummated. Supply in translation,
“ who resort to polygamy.” — plurimis nuptiis ambiuntur:
are the objects of sollicitation for plural marriaye. As an his-
torical instance of a polygamous marriage initiated for reasons
of state, recall Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1. 53; duae fuerunt
Ariovisti uxores . . . altera Norica, repis Voccionis soror, quam
in Gallia duaeerat a fratre missam.

5. dotem non uxor marito: in contrast with the Classical
Greek and Roman practice, according to which the marriage
of a portionless woman was well nigh unthinkable. The action
in the Trz‘nwmnus of Plautus centers in such a proposal‚ re-
garded by the brother and the guardian of the bride-to-be as
spelling family disgrace ; see, ray„ line 612, flayz'tium quidem hercle
fiet, nisi dos dabitur virqini (⁶ it will be a sin out and out if a

, dowry isn't given to the maiden').—uxori maritus offert:

Tacitus describes inexactly the marriage by purchase‚ prevalent
in his time in Germany. This usage, which in primitive society
succeeded marriage by capture, was in vogue in Homeric Greece
and existed among the Thracians in the time of Xenophon,
to whom Seuthes says, Anabasis 7. 2. 38, ‘ If you have a daughter,
I will buy her according to the Thracian eustom! The dos
constituted the price paid for the transfer of the woman from
the potestas of her father to that of her husband; it was not
paid to her, as Tacitus sayS‚ but to her parents. The inaccuracy
of Tacitus is due to his desire to make the contrast between
Roman and German practice as pointed as possible. A later
step involved giving the portion or a part of it to the bride.
