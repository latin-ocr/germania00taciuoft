Ubii: a powerful tribe. dwelling in Caesar‘s time in Hesse-
Nassau, opposite Coblentz. Having been harried constantly by
the Suebi, they put themselves under the protection of Caesar,
and it was partly in response to their solicitations that he crossed
the Rhine in 55 13.c. Some years later, probably in 38 13.c.,
although there is some evidence pointing to 19 B.c. as the date
of the event, they were transported across the Rhine under the
patronage of Agrippa and established in the vicinity of Cologne
(colonia). ·

20. Romana colonia: in 50 ΑΛ). the capital of the expatriated
Ubii, Oppidum or Ara Ubiorum, was organized as a Roman
colony at the instigation of Nero's mother, Agrippina, whose ⁷
birthplace it was. — meruerint: earned the riqlzt. — Agrip-
pinenses: the colony was variously designated Colonia Ayrip-
pinensi-s or -ium, also, with official formality, Colonia Claudia
Auyusta Agrippinensium and Colonia Claudia Ara Aqrippinensis.

21.' conditoris ι the word is used in a broad, not in a technical,
sense and refers to Agrippina, under whose patronage the colony
was organized. According to Annales 12. 27, the epithet had a
subsidiary significance in perpetuating the memory of Agrippa’s
relation to the Ubii.

Conditriz is used only in late Latin; even if there had been
precedent for the word, Tacitus might well have chosen the
form in -tor here, as he does in the case of laudator in 7. 13—4‚
hi (i.e. feminae) . . . sanctissimi testes, hi maximi laudatores.

22. experimento fidei: as a result os their proved loyalty.

Decumates.

1. virtute praecipui: cohorts of the Batavi had rendered
yeoman service to Rome in the German wars waged by Drusus,
Tiberius, and Germanicus; they had also served with great
distinction in Britain; cf. Historiae 4. 12 and note on Ayricola
36. 5. In the great revolt under Civilis, 69-70 A.D., they offered
stubborn resistance, and, peace having been made on terms
favorable to them, they retained immunity from taxation and a
privileged position as regards military service.
