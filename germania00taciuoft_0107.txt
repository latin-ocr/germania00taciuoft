Weryeld was naturally computed in terms of the prevalent
standard of valuation. Compensatory damages varied with the
rank of the victim.

4. universa domus: responsibility in a blood feud is collec-
tive and rests on the family; hence all those concerned share in
the settlement.

5. utiliter in publicum: characterizing the compensatory
system as a whole, not simply the detail last mentioned, sotis-

hospitem violare sas non (Germani) patant. Qui quacumque de
causa ad eos venerunt, ab iniuria prohibent, sanctos habent hisque
omnium domus patent victusque communicatur.

In the code of hospitality kindly treatment of the guest is a
