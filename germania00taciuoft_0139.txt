Norns Ι 107

following eulogistic description. in which the characteristics of a
humanized and pacifically inclined people are attributed to them,
has a suspiciously rhetorical tone. lt is possible that. lacking
exact information as to the situation and traits of this remote
tribe of northwest Gerniany, Tacitus has done here what he
accuses his predecessors of doing in their accounts of Britain,
viz. resorting to rhetoric as a substitute for facts

7. populus . . . nobilissimus: Taeitus's eulogy of the Chauci
is notably at odds with the account of them given by Pliny,
Naturalis Historia 16. (l). 2, who writes as an eye-witness and
describes them as a poor fisherfolk, ekeing out a wretched exist-
ence in huts, which were situated on dunes and artificial em-
bankments and which were entirely surrounded at high tide.
Pliny's narrative doubtless applied only to the fringe of the
tribe along the coast and is as much too restricted as the account
of Tacitus is too general.

8. iustitia: selected as the chief motis in this encomium of the
Chauci and developed in the following sentence.

9. impotentia: “ the weakrzess of uncontrolled passion,’‘ as
it has been happily defined. ——- secreti: this epithet would fit the
Chauci of the coast, but not those who, according to Tacitus,
peopled the inmensum terrarum spatium in the interior, and were
surrounded by neighborS.

10. nullis raptibus . . . populantur: nevertheleSS, under the
leadership of Gannascus, a chieftain of the Canninefates, the
Chauci, after the manner of the Vikings of a later age, had com-
mitted a piratical foray against the coast of Gaul in 47 A.D.;
cf. Annales 11. 18.

11. quod: the fact that. -- ut superiores agant: the verb has
here its intransitive sense of live, exist, and the clause may be
rendered by an abstract noun, aq. (their) ascendancy.

12. non per iniurias: a repetition of the theme iustitia.

13. exercitus : this word, when applied to a force of barbariam,
connotes an organized army and not an undisciplined host. So
in Aqricola 32. 24 the words of Calgacus, hic duoe, hic exercitus,
voice a claim in keeping with the hortatory spirit of the address.
The Chauci, like the Chatti, had adopted Roman methodS.

14. et: = etiam.
