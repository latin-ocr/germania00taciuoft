THE MACMILLAN LATIN
CLASSICS ·

PREPARED UNDER THE DlRECTlON OF

erixffis C. EGBERT

PROFESSOR OF LATIN IN COLUMBIA L'NIVERSITY

FOR THE YOUNGER STUDENTS IN COLLEGE CLASSES

Although great progress has been made during re-
cent years in the scholarly editing of Latin texts, the
result has been books too cumbersome and expensive
for the younger students. Not finding helpful infor-
mation in the elaborate introduction with its extensive
data as *to usages‚ quotations‚ and references, the stu-
dent naturally turns to translations for aid. The vol-
umes in this new series will endeavor to combat this
tendency by presenting notes which, while scholarly‚
shall be brief and concise. Each book will have a
short introduction and standard text and a commentary
for the interpretation of the text. The series will con-
tain the most useful works available for class use and
will be issued at prices sufficiently reasonable to make
the adoption of the volumes possible in large general
classes.
