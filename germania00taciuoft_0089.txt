9. regi vel civitati: this procedure was based on the theory
that the perpetrator of a crime had sinned against the state as
well as against the victim. Hence in inonarchical states the
king, elsewhere the community‚ received as compensation sor
the breach of public peace which had been committed, a per-
centage of the Weryeld.

10. propinquis eius: when murder had been done or when

dependent on the consilinm, ‘ advice‚' and auctoritas, ‘ sanction,’
