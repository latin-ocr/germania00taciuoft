cf. modern German Marlc, ⁶ boundary.’ Since the last decade
13.c.‚ they had occupied Bohemia, where, under the leadership
of their king. Marobod, they formed the nucleus of a powerful
confederacy. Their supremacy was ended for the time being
when King Marobod was defeated in a war with the Cherusci,
begun in 17 A.D., was abandoned by his allies, and forced to
take refuge in Italy. The second century A.D. witnessed a
renascence of their power and, in a series of wars with Rome
in the time of Marcus Aurelius, they were put down only after
a stubborn contest.

2. Quadi: akin to the Marcomanni and closely united with
their history during the first two centuries of the Empire. Their
territory was the modern Moravia.

3. pulsis olim Boiis: the fact that the great mass of the
Boii had left their original seats and been dispersed in various
lands in the west and the south some years prior to the time
of Caesar's campaigns in Gaul, whereas the Marcomanni under
Marobod did not settle in Bohemia until the close of the century,
has caused the accuracy of this assertion to be questioned. How-
ever, bands of the Marcomanni, abandoning their former abode
between the Main and the Danube, had established themselves
in Bohemia during the period of the emigrations of the Boii.
These earlier incursions had at least paved the way for the
occupation of the territory by Marobod, and it is possible that
remnants of the Boii that still maintained a foothold offered a
futile resistance to him.

5. velut frons: these tribes are thought of as facing Rome.
—peragiturz is constituted by; a different region, of course,
would be srons Germaniae where the Rhine formed the bound-
ary.

7. Tudri: mentioned here only.

8. iam et externos: as iam indicates, recent events are here
referred to, but we are ignorant as to the details of the change
in dynasty.

10. nec minus: their position is maintained as effectively by
financial aid as by armed intervention; cf. 15. 12, iam et pecuniam
accipere docuimus.
