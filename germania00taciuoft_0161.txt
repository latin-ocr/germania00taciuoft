NorEs 129

exploration. — ergo iam: the connection is: since this northern
region marks the end of the known world and there is nothing
more to be said concerning this locality, I turn accordingly at
this point to the east coast of the Baltic.

⁰1. Aestiorum gentes: the pcoples who dwelt along the Baltic.
in East Prussia and Russia as far as the Gulf of Finland. They
were non-Germanic in origin and were the ancestors of the Old
Prussians, LithuanianS, and Letts. It is supposed that the
modern Esthom'ans‚ though of Finnish stock, have perpetuated
the name. ῃ

8. lingua Britannicae propior: the ears of unscientific ob-
servem, probably tradem, detected in the language of the Aestii
sounds which bore a certain resemblance to the more familiar
Celtic. Similarly, in Ayricola ll. 12, Tacitus cites the resem-
blance between the languages of the Gauls and the southeast
Britons as an indication that the latter were of Gallie extraction.
However, neither Tacitus nor the ancient world in general had
anything but a rudimentary conception of the utilization of
lingujstic criteria in the differentiation of races.

9. matrem deum: the data are too meager to justify our
assuming on the basis of this context the actual existence among
these peoples of the cult of a mother goddess. Figures of boars
were worn as amulets by the devotees of Magna Mater in Rome
and similar insignia, seen on the natives of the East Baltic coast,
may have without further reason inspired the theory.

10. omnium: neuter. The genitive is objective.

Belief in the efficacy of inanimate objects to protect the bearer
from harm‚ emanating from natural or supernatural sources is
ages old and still finds expression in modern times, aq. in the
Italian's faith in his coral prophylactic against the evil eye.
The superstition has never been confined to one race or branch
of mankind. In Northern Europe graves, dating back to the
Stone and Bronze Ages, have yielded amulets of many types and
fashioned from many materials‚ such as stone, horn, shell. the
teeth, bones, and claws (of. ‘ the rabbit's foot ’ of Negro supersti-
tion) οἱ various animals.

14. laborant: in Augustan poetry, the accusative follows
laborare to denote the thing wrought out or produced by work.
