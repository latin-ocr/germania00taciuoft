of the community was sequestratcd and worked for a certain
period, while the residuum was allowed to lie fallow. How
frequently a shift in the field of operations occurred and a dif-
ferent area was broken, Tacitus does not say. This might be
after a longer or shorter period, according to the fertility of the
tract. VVhenever a change was made, the new tract chosen for
cultivation naturally had to be commensurate with the number
of households in the community‚ a number which, of course,
would be subject to variation.

communal but the individual held property rights over the
homestead, yard, and the household chattels. In certain
primitive civilizations ‘to-day, notably in the South Seas, collec-
tive ownership is theoretically absolute and extends to all
property and chattels.—in vices occupantur: are taken up
successively‚ literally, with a view to chanyes. As has been said,
Tacitus says *nothing about any fixed interval of rotation.
However, it is evident that the successive occupatione of tracts
of plowland did not involve a change in the location of the vil-
lage community. Any such annual series of expropriations as
that described by Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 6. 22. 2 : maqistratas

a predatory race of nomadic instincts as were the Suebi, whom
Caesar had mainly in mind, is out of keeping with Tacitus’s
picture of German life, a feature of which is permanence of
abode, comparatively speaking. Furthermore, the following
context implies that tenure of a given territory was continuous
or for a period of some duration. — quos mox . . . partiuntur:
each new tract selected for cultivation by the village corporation
was subdivided into quotas to be worked by the individual house-
holders. This system presupposes for the time being a differ-
entiation among the individual parcels and hence marks a devel-
opment over the conditions depicted by Caesar, who says
that, at least among the Suebi, there was a total absence of
