NOTES . 99

paigns against them were still recent history and the praise
bestowed on them by Tacitus is of a picco with his disparagement
of Domitian's achievements against them; cf. note on Ayricola
39. 4.—Hereynio saltu: applied, as is the case with Hercyniam
silvam in chap. 28, to a part of the whole tract. The wooded
tanges are a feature of the topography of Hesse.

11. ratione . . . concessum: vouchsafed under α studied
plan os discipline.

12. robur in pedite: cf. Aqricola 12. 1 : in pedite robur.
