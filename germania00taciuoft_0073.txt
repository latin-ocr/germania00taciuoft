1¹7. numerus: i.e. peditum delectorum. As we should expect
and as is illustrated by the passages from Caesar referred to
above, the functions of the cavalry in combats in which the
mixti were engaged, was taken for granted, hence in description
is subordinated to the part played by the chosen infantry, the
agility and prowess displayed by them. They were regarded as
an §lite body — thus in the Pharsalian campaign we find Caesar
selecting them from the antestqnanz· — and might well receive a
distinetive name. — pagis : here a large territorial subdivision of
a civitas, such as those into which the Suebi were divided accord-

ing to Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 4. 1. The size of the Suebian .

paqus may be inferred from the fact that each was populous enough
to put a thousand warriors in the field every year and to retain an
equal number of men at home to till the fields.

19. acies: the main body of the army. — per cuneos: later
writers liken this formation to a boar’s head, caput porcinum.

20. cedere loco: the regular idiom for deserting one's post.
Roman military theory disapproved even of strategio with-
drawals; failure to maintain a prescribed position rendered
soldjers liable to severe penalty, as the following passage in the
Isise os Auqustus, written by Suetonius, a contemporary of Taci-
tus, well attests ε ‘ If any cohorts gave way in battle (si cessissent
loco), Augustus decimated them and fed the rest on barley (in-
stead of the usual rations of wheat) ; when centurions left their
posts‚ he punished them with death just as he did the rank and
file' (ehap. 24, Rolfe's translation).

21. quam: with ellipsis of potius, as in various passages else-
where in the works of Tacitus.

22. praecipuum flagitium: the heiqht os insamy; praecipuus
has here a superlative force, a frequent connotation of the word
in Latin of this period. Cf. Montesquieu, Spirit os the Laws
xxviii, chap. xxi: ‘ The ancient Salio Law allows a composition
of fifteen sous (120 denarii) to any person that had been injuri-
ously reproached with having left his buckler behind.’ The
severity of Spartan feeling toward the ῥίψασπις is well known;
however, Greek poets and, after them, the Roman Horace were
not above jesting on the subject.

23. concilium: the popular assembly described in chap. 11—12.
