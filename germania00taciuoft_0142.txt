110 NOTES

4. ambitu . . . metiaris: similarly the abandoned camp sites
of Varus and his logions, which were discovered by the army of
Germanicus in 15 A.t›., gave mute testimony as to the size of the
forces whieh built and occupied them; cf. Annales 1. 61: prima
l'ari castra lato ambita et dimensis principiis trium leyionum manus
ostentabant (¹ the first. encampment of Varus by its broad circuit
and its regularly marked officers' quarters, gave evidence of the
work of three legions ’). —- molem manusque: not necessarily a
hendiadys, as often explained. Moles is the whole mass of the
tribe, including women and children, which the camp would have
to be large enough to contain; manas refers to the fighting
strength.

5. tam magni exitus fidem: the authenticity os so areat an
emiyration. The Cimbri and the Teutons are said by Plutarch,
M arias 11, to have numbered 300,000 fighting men besides the
women and the children! An accurate determination of their
number is i1npossible; it doubtless increased in the course of
their wanderings— sescentesimum et quadragesimum annum:
according to our generally accepted method of reckoning, the
Varronjan era, Metellus and Carbo were consuls in 113 B.c.‚ on
April 21 of which year, A. U. C. 641 began. Sometime during
the campaigning season of the year, Carbo by negotiations suc-
ceeded in preventing the Cimbri from crossing the Carnian Alps
but was subsequently defeated by them. The news of the ap-
proach of the Germans may conceivably have reached Rome
before April 21, i.e. in the closing weeks of the year 640, although
such an hypothesis assumes a meticulous regard for chronological
minutiae in general foreign to Tacitus and the other ancient his-
torians. The divergence in calculation is at most a matter of
months and we may be sure that Tacitus in any case would have
preferred the round number; cf. Ayricola 34. 14, where with
greater license forty-two years are expanded into half a hundred.

8. ad alterum . . . Traiani consulatum: 98 A.D., the year. in
which the Germania was written.

10. vincitur: the tense implies that the conquest is not yet
complete. If this is a thrust at Domitian and his celebration of a
triumph over Germany, as is generally assumed, it is none the
less a reminder to Trajan.
