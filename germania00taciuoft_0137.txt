to mention such an ethnic partition of the Frisians, although
the Bructeri were so dividua (of. note on 33. l), and Pliny the
Elder distinguishes the Chauci, closely akin in origin to the
Frisians‚ and their near neighbors on the coast of the North Sea,
by the same terminology (Naturalis Historia 16. (l). 2). It
is probable, that, as has been assumed in the case of the Bructeri,
the epithets indicate the separation between a mother stock
(maiores) and an emigrated colony (minores).

4. utraeque: acerque is not infrequently used in its plural
forms when either of the two members involved denotes a col-

to say : Septentrionalis vero Oceanus maiore er parte naviqalas est
auspiciis divi Aaqusli (‘but the greater part of the Northern
Ocean was traversed under the auspices of the deified Augustus ’).

8. Herculis columnas: the fame of the Pillars of Hercules at
Gibraltar, marking the limits of the known world to the west,
and of such roeky barriers as the Symplegades in the east at the
entrance of the Black Sea, stimulated the location of analogous
portals elsewhere, and naturally in the mysterious north. Some
traveler's ‘¹ yarn '' of great eliffs or rocky islets (cf. Pliny,
