Chapter 38.

The Suebian races; their characteristic national head-dress.

1. nunc de Suebis: the account of the peoples gathered by
Tacitus under the generic term Suebi is continued through
chap. 45. From the information here given, the sources of
which it is impossible to fix, it would appear that the name was
applied to a confederation of separat-e, though cognate, races,
united in the worship of a common divinity. Their original
habitat, bounded on the west by the Elbe, extended far to the
east and northeast, whence it is that the Baltic could be called
Suebicum M are (chap. 45). Their adventurous and aggressive
temperament led to constant expansion of their domination,
mentioned by Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 4. 3, as a national am-

haunts before the time of Caesar and had established them-
selves in Southern and Southwestern Germany. Here they
made such races as the Usipetes, Tencteri, and Ubii chronic
victims of their ‘⁴ will to power,” and ultimately became known
to Caesar as qens lonye maxima et bellicosissima Germanorum
omnium.

The name, in all probability originating in non-Suebian peoples
and having the general force of an epithet, was easily extensible
and naturally as applicable to any one of the races of the con-
federation as their ethnic name proper. Furthermore, the rapid
growth of Suebian power doubtless caused confusion between
the true Suebi and races which had come under their sphere
of influence. These considerations help to explain the varia·-

sources The term, as utilized by Tacitus in chap. 2, is com-
posite but, is restricted to true Suebian stocks which had occupied
territory west and south of the Elbe, being set off from the
peoples of Eastern German& embraced under the name Vandilii.
