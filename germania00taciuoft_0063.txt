it embraces the Semnones, Chatti, and other tribes of Soutlwrn

38 we shall see that the peoples included under the name were
much more widely emended—Vandilios: originally applied,
as in Pliny, Natural History 4. (28). 90 and in this passage, to
an ethnic division comprising many peoples of Eastern Germany,
the name, in its later form Vandali, was restricted to the tribe
famous in the period of the Germanic migrations into the Empire.

that most of the Belgae were deseended from Germanic invaders
who, tempt'ed by the fertility of the soil, had crossed the Rhine
and ejected the Celtic inhabitants. Antiquitas is the word
used by Caesar to define the date of this migration; it was at

The Remi furnished Caesar with the data for this part of his
narrative; however, there seems to be no ground for distrusting
the accur-acy of the account, although elsewhere in the Gallie
War the reliability of information derived from native sources is
open to question.

Bellum Gallicum 2. 4. 10, a confederation of four tribes of Belgio
Gaul, the Condrusi, Eburones, Caerosi, and Caemani, bore col-
lectively the name Germani. A view which has gained wide
acceptance is that this was the term applied by the Celts to the
Teutonic intruders. Its etymology is uncertain. The accuracy
of the statement of Tacitus, that peoples once called Germani
were in his time known as Tungri, is substantiatcd by the fact
that, in the first century of the Empire, Tungri occupied the
territory adjacent to Aduatuca, once the chief city of Caesar's
Eburones (Germani), and later called Aduatuca Tongrorum,
