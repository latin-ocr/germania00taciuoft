PREFACE

IN this country, as well as alu-oud, pedagogieal tradition
has long treated the Agyrio-ola and the Germania as coordinal
elements of the Latin curriculum. This book, the prepalu-

tion of which has been retarded by pressure of other work, ⁸

is now offered as the companion of 1ny edition of the Agyrio-ola
(N ew York, 1909).

In so far as the intrinsic differens-es between the two
treatises permit, the plan of this edition aecords with that
of its predecessor. The notes, necessarily somewhat more
elaborate than the commentar-y on the Agyre‘cola, have been
written primarily with an eye to the needs and interests of
the learner. In eonforlnity with a suggestion of the editor
of the series, parallel citations drawn from works that are
presumably known to the young Student by name only, if
at all, have been translated. In general, originality has
been less a desideratum than reliability3 however, Ι have
essayed to present my own summm-y and appraisal of the
multifarious data which the last generation of criticism has
yielded.

No editor of this book of Tacitus ean claim the right to
a hearing who has not taken strict account of the work of
German scholars, who, conseious that for them, in a peculiar
sense, the Germania speaks of

“ virum monumenta priorum‚''
