“which materian>- and morally surpassed the day of Cannae '¹
(Mommsen). Caepione and ,llullz'o are joined closely, apart from
Scauro. because his ‹letaclnnent was eut to pieces and he him-
self captured in an engagmnent separate from the battle proper.

18. quinque : ror the sake ol‘ making as strong a case as possi-
ble, Tacitus has committed a slight exaggeration ; Carbo’s army
.sufl'ered a reverse but was not destroyed. Another defeat which
Tacitus might have added to his catalogue was that inflicted on
M. Iunius Silanus and his army in 109 13.c.

20. Caesari abstulerunt: for, under the Empire, the princeps
was de jure commander-in-ehies of the armies and expeditioris
were carried out under his auspices. In connection with ab·
stalerunt we may compare the wail of Augustus, Suetonius,
Anqustus 23: Quintili Vare, lcyioncs redde—Marius in Italia:
of the two great victor-ies, one at Aquae Sextiae in Gaul (102
iac.) «and the other at Vercellae near the Po (101 13.c.), by
which Italy was saved for the time being from conquest by the
Germans, the latter only is mentioned, doubtless because it
was the final. and decisive engagement.

21. Iulius in Gallia: the victory over Ariovistus in 58 13.c.
and the rout of the Usipetes and the Tencteri in 55 B.c.‚ are

instances in point. — Nero: i.e. Tiberius.
22. ingentes Gai Caesaris minae: Caligula⁷s expedition of
39 A.D.‚ referred to in Aqricola‚ 13. 11 f.: ni . . . inqentes ad-

versus Germaniam conatus frustra fuissent. As has been pointed
out in the note on this passage of the Aqricola, the actual achieve-
ments of the campaign were out of keeping with its pretensions.
though as a military demonstration it may not have been entirely
futile. We may be sure that Caligula's acts lost nothing of the
picturesque in the accounts given of him by the ancient historians.

24. occasione . . . civilium armorum: coincident with the
civil wars of 69 Α.ι>., the “ Year of the Four Emperors,'' was the
insurrection of the Batavi under the leadership of Civilis; the
revolt was undertakcn ostensibly to further the cause of Ves-
pasian against Vitellius, but was continued after the former
had made good his claim to the principate.

so-called salsus e Germania triumphus (Ayricola 39. 4), cele-
