NOTEs 51

the Corpus Inscriptionnm Latinarum, vol. l, nos. 1438 et seq.
——frugiferae arbori: not a fruit trec in our sense of the term.
Fruyiser is applied to any tree or shrub whi‹·}1 produces nuts
or berries, e.9. the oak, beech, elder, and juniper. The pre-
requisite here mentioned was not observed universally by all
peoples who resorted to divina-tion of this mode. *Thus the
Finns took no cognizance of such a rule; the Scythians used
willow wands (Herodotus, 4. 67); see also the reference in
Plautus mentioned above.

3. notis: signs or symbols, carrying with them some definite
implication and, as the following sentence shows, widely in- ’
telligible, since the father of the household was able to interpret
them as well as the priest. Some scholars have preferred to
see in these notae a reference to the characters of the Runic
alphabet, derived from the Latin capitaIS. However it is
doubtful whether the Runes were known to the Germans in
the first century As). In any case, so strong is the conservative
tendeney in matters pertaining to religion and the occult, that
the traditio-nal signs would have maintained themselves for a
time in the face of an innovation. The prestige of the lots of
Ptaeneste rested partly on the fact that they were written in
an archaic alphabet; cf. Cicero, De Divinatione 2. 41. 85,
quoted above.

5. publice: as an affair os state.

6. pater familiae: as was the case in Roman religion, the
father officiated as family priest in the ceremonies of the house-
hold ritual. It is noteworthy that, in contrast with Caesar,
Bellum Gallicum 1. 50. 4, Tacitus ignores the matres familiae
as diviners by lot. In Roman usage procedure varied. Often,
owing to the common folk belief that the guilelessncss of child-
hood commended it especially as the vehicle for expressing the
divine purposes‚ a puer played an important part in the cere-
mony; at Praeneste he shuffled and drcw the lots; sometimes
he seems to have acted as interpretem cf. Tibullus, 1. 3. 11-12.
In Horace’s parody of the practice, a Sabine crone acts as sorli-
lequ3,· Satires 1. 9. 29 f. — caelumque suspiciens: not to avoid
seeing the surculi but as an expression of a petition for divine
guidance to be djsclosed in the lots.
