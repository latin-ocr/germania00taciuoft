120 NOTES

precis-ion in the language of Tacitus which seems unlikely in
th(- face of the tendeney, constantly visible in Roman mythology
and religion, to blond the personalities and the functions of
ops, Terra, Magna Mater, Ceres, et cet—intervenire ε minyles in.

8. invehi populis: populis is dative. The image of the god-
dess, we are to understand, was drawn from place to place;
cs. the allusion in Tibullus 1. 4. 68-9, to the similar progress
of the car of Cybele, escorted by her priests:

Idaeae carras ille sequatur Opis
et tercentenas erroribus expleat urbes

(‘ let him follow the cars of Idaean Ops and complete the tale
of thrice a hundred cities in his wanderings ’). —- insula Oceani:
an old but erroneous folk tradition settled on Riigen, off the
coast of Pomerankr, in the Baltic, as the sacred isle and furnished
it with a Lake Hertha, a name derived from a manuscript
corruption of Nertlms (cf. the similar origin of ‘⁴ Grampian ''
from a mistaken reading Grampius for Graupius in Aqricola
29. 8). Later scholarship, with an enthusiasm pardonable but
barren of results, has advanced the claims of other islands both
in the Baltic and the North Sea. — eastum nemus: the grove
was kept unviolated by mortal tread; cf. Ovid, Fasti 4. 751,
the prayer of the shepherd to Pales: Si nemus intravi vetitum
. . . da veniam culpae (⁴ If I have entered a forbidden grove,
grant mercy to my fault ⁷).

9. veste: a trappinq of eloth.

10. penetrali: the wagon is the ark of the goddess.

11. bubus feminis: the chariot of Magna Mater was also
drawn by cows.

12. quaecumque . ⁷. . dignatur: it has been assumed by
a recent critic that, because the center of the cult of Nerthus
was on an island, the whole ceremonialwas necessarily confined
to the one district and that large deputations, the populife-
ferred to above, were sent by the participating states and es-
tablished themselves in separate camps around the sacred grove.
Even though Tacitus does not say how the goddess and her
car were transported to the mainland, his language certainly
makes for the view that they were. Populi can hardly mean
