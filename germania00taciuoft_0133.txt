Norns Δ 101

may judge from Tacitus's characterization of the act of Civilis
as barbarum volum, such a pledge on the part of Caesar would
have been un-Roman.

5. super sanguinem et spolia: the vivid description is
heightened by the alliteration. For a similar combination of
the words in a rhetorical passage see the speech of Civilis
Historiae 4. 14: quos ubl spoliis el sanquine expleverint. γ

7. ignavis et imbellibus: combined also in chap. 12. 3—4 and
in Ayricola 15. 11.

8. squalor: this word and its cognatos, squalidus, squaleo, are
frequently used of the unkempt, matted condition resulting
from neglect of the hair or bcard.

There is no real inconsistency involved between this sentence
and the account following, from which it appears that the
bravest warriors left their hair and beard uncut. Tacitus does
not say that only the ianam· et imbelles remained unshorn. The
members of the warrior brotherhood, whose flowing locks were
a token of valor, would be easily distinguishable as a class
apart. —ferreum . . . anulum: under other circumstances,
symbolical of servitude or personal liability‚ hence a ba-dge of in-
famy; in this case the ring is plausibly to be regarded as betoken-
ing a sels-imposed bondage to the war god, Wodan.

10. plurimis: a qoodly number.—hic . . . habitus: the flow-
ing hair and beard, also the ring.

11. iam . . . canent insignes: they become already yray wilh
aye while bearing] these distinctions.

13. nova: uncanny. —namz explanatory not only of nova
but also of prima . . . acies. Their forbidding exterior, unaltered
even in times of peace, is an effective means of striking terror to
the hearts of the foe at the first outbreak of hostilities. Hence
they are utilized in the front rank. The hideous masks once
worn by the Japanese Samurai and the war paint of the Indian
may be cited as analogous devices.

natural order, is proceeding in thought from the mouth of the
