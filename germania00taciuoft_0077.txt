NOTEs 45

Romanis traderent, Bellum Gallicam l. 51, 3. The women of
the Cimbri, exhibiting a more desperate courage‚ killed the
fugitives before committing suicide themselves, Plutarch,
M arius 27.

3. comminus captivitate: join in translation —- the imminence
os captivity. —quam longe inpatientius . . . timent: an un-
usual combination of words, since inpatientius is· naturally
used of adversity borne in praesenti rather than dreaded in
futuro. Here both ideas are blended. Translate: tlte terrors
os which they reqard as sar more ztnbearable οιι tlte womcn's ac-
count (than on their own).

6. puellae quoque nobiles: puellae is the emphatic word; as a
rule, only persons of high rank were acceptable as hostages, hence
nobiles is, strictly speaking, dispensable. — inesse: sc. seminis.

7. providum: the Pythias, Sibyls‚ witche& and fortune-
tellers of many races and epochs prove that the tendency to
endow woman with mystic powers is universal. — nec aut
consilia earum aspernantur: recall Caesar's words, Bellum
Gallicum 1.“ 50. 4: apud Germanos ea consuetudo (crat) at matres
familiae eorum sortibus et vaticinationibus declararent, utrum
proelium committi er usa esset necne. In deference to the pro-
phetie advice of the women, Ariovistus refused to give battle
until the moon was full.

8. vidimus: the first person does not prove that Tacitus
saw Veleda with his own eyes; we know that she was taken
' captive but not that she was actually brought to Rome. Tacitus
may well be expressing himself as spokesman for his time and
mean simply nostra aetas vidit.

9. Veledam: as we learn from several passages in the His—
tories in which mention of her is made, Veleda was an inspired
maiden of the tribe of the Bructeri. She lived apart in a tower
on the banks of the Lippe and, as a result of the prestige gained
by the fulfillment of her prophecies as to the success of German
arms, she shared with Civilis chief prominence in the revolt of
the Batavi in 69—70 Aa).

10. Albrfinam: not mentioned elsewhere. The name rests
on conjecture and means one ‘ endowed with the magio power

of the elves.’
