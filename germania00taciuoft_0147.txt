following chapter& to includo. all tho peoples of Eastern Ger-
many between the Danube and tho Baltic, the Suiones of the
‘ Scandjnavian Peninsula, and own some non-Germanic raceS,
transcends all limits of usage vlsowlwre and rests upon a differ-
ent set of data from that utilizcd in chap. 2.

3. adhuc: besides, i.c. in addition to the collective name
Suebi.

6. obliquare crinem : to comb the hair othmare (from its natural
direction or ‘hang '). The looks thus arranged lay across or
αι an anyle with the perpendicular lines in which they would
have hung had they been combed down—nodo . . . sub-

variation‚ as we might surmise and as is evident from line ll below.

No member contrasting with rarum is expressed because the
fashion has been characterized as common to the whole body of
Suebian fre-emen. — retro sequuntur: the locution is surprising;
perhaps the image present in the mind of the writer is the move-

arrangement.

11. ornatiorem: α more elaborate arranqement; sc. capillum.

12. ut ament amenturve: a shaft directed at the fop and
debauche of Roman society. A too punctilious arrangement
of the hair was proverbially a mark of effeminacy; see, e.9.,
the biting epigram of Calvus on Pompey, M aquus quem metuunt
omnes, dioilo caput uno scalpit, et seq. (⁴ Magnus, of whom all
