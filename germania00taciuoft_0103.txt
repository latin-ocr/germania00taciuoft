mi natura dedit leyes a sanquine ducta-3
ne possem melior i udicis esse metu
(‘ to me nature gave a code derived from my blood, making me
a woman beyond the possibility of betterment through sear of
a judge ').
Note the epigrammatic and rhetorically balanced structure of
this closing sentence of the chapter.

Chapter 20.

Child nurture; laws of relationship and inheritance.

1. in omni domo: among rich and poor alike.—nudi ac
sordidi: to take these epithets literally is not to do violence to
the probabilities. This is the system (?) of child nurture usual
among a primitive people, and that, after all, is what the Ger-
mans ‚of Tacitus were. Note in this connection the following:
‘⁶ Children of the Eskimo on the eastern coast of Greenland go
naked in the house until they are sixteen years old. Then they
put on the notit (loia-eloth) and that is the only thing worn in
the house by adults. It is the custom of wearing fur next the
skin (see note on 17. 3) which compels them to go naked in the
house.'’ W. G. Sumner, Foth-ways, p. 441.

2. quemque mater . . . alit: referred to in Dialoqus 28 as an
old-time Roman virtue. The diseontinuanee of this practice
was deplored by educational theorists‚ especially because of the
supposed deleterious effects on the mentality and character of
the rising generation incur-red by intrusting children to the care
of hirelings; cf. Agricola 4. 8·, Dialoqus 29; Plutarch, Dis-
course on the Traininy os Children, chap. 5.

3. nec ancillis ae nutricibus: cf. the language of Dialoqus 28:
Nam pridem suus cuique filius ez casta parente natus, non in
cellula emptae nutricis sed aremio ac sinu matris educabatur
(⁶ In the good old days, every man's son. born in wedlock, was
brought up not in the chamber of some hii-eling nurse, but in
his mother's lap and at her knee ’ —Peterson); 29: At nunc
natus infans deleantur Graeculae alicui ancillae (⁵ Nowadays, on
the other hand, our children are handed over at their birth to
some silly little Greek serving-maid ' — Peterson). —- dominum:
strictly, in old-time Southern parlance, the ‘⁶ young master.'’
