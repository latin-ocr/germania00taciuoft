122 NOTEs

Chatti; their lands extended north to the Hartz Mts. and east
to the Elbe, thus embracing thelSaxon Duchies and Southern
Saxony. They figure in later history as the Thuringi.

4. in ripa : of the Danube. Their territory did not extend to the
river but they were allowed free access to it for purposes of trade.

5. penitus: said from the point of view of the Hermunduri,
who were permitted to pass into Roman territory.

6. colonia: Augusta Vindelicorzmz, situated somewhat north
of the modern Augsburg‚ and founded as a market town by
Drusus in 15 B.c. The place did not, in the time of Trajan,
have technjcally the standing of a colonia, hence Tacitus has
used the term here in a free, not a formal, sense. — passim et
sine custode: the limes ordinarily formed a customs-barrier
which rigorously eontrolled the entry of the Germans even
when bound on peaceful errands ; passage was allowed at specified
places only, the incoming barbarian had to pay a fee and to
submit to disarmament and surveillance.

8. domos villasque: they were allowed access to town- and
country-houses alike.

9. Albis oritur: the domains of the Hermunduri certainly
did not embrace Bohemia, where the Elbe takes its rise. Either
Tacitus was under the impression that the source of the river
was in the Erzgebirge between Saxony and Bohemia‚ or he mis-
took the Saale, a tributary of the Elbe, for the Elbe proper.

10. notum olim: Drusus and Tiberius had penetrated to the
Elbe and, in 2 13.o.‚ L. Domitius Ahenobarbus had operated on
the eastern bank. In 17 A.D. Germanicus, after his recall from
Germany, celebrated a triumph over the Cherusci, the Chatti,
the Angrivarii, and ‘ the other nations which extend as far as
the Elbe,’ with more reclamo, however, than his conquests
justified—nunc . . . auditur: because, with the recall of
Germanicus by Tiberius, the policy of wide expansion in Ger-
many had been relinquished.
