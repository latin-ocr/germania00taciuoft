doses in the Tacitean manner, with an effective sentence—

Chapter 15.

The comitatus in time of peace.

1. ineunt: the subject is the princeps and the comites. The
comitatus is still uppermost in the mind of the writer, as the
allusion to principes in line 8 shows. —— non multum venatibus:
on the sui-face a restriction of Caesar's testimony as to the

a short point. Hence large weaponS‚ involving as they would

12. phalerae: medallions, used as trappings for horses and
worn as articles of personal adornment. Specimens have been
