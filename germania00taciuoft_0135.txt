as we use the expression “better man ” with reference to the
superiority of one of two combatants over his rival.

Chapter 33.

The Bructeri, the Chamavi, and the Angrivarii.

1. iuxta : said from the point of view of one who is going north
into the interior, away from the Rhine. — Bructeri: divided by
other ancient sources into the Greater Bructeri and the Lesser ;
the latter, whose defeat by the Chamavi and the Angrivarii is
here alluded to, had detached themselves from the rest of their
tribe and taken possession of the territory between the Upper-
Lippe and the Upper Ems. The race was well known to the
Romans as a redoubtable foe. At the battle of the Teutoburg
Forest they captured the eagle of the l9th Legion but the stand-
ard was recovered by a punitive expedition sent among them
by Germanicus. The Lesser Bructeri and their prophetess‚
Veleda (see note on 8. 9), had taken a prominent part in the revolt
of Civilis. — occurrebant: in a geographical sense, equivalent to
habitabant. — nunc : the event was, therefore, arecent occurrence.
This defeat —* it by no means amounted to annihilation of the
Lesser Bructeri, as Tacitus reports — occurred in the interval
between the year 70 ΑΛ). and the date of this treatise.

2. Chamavos: their seat was in Holland‚ southeast of the
Zuyder Zee. Their conquest of the Bructeri enabled them to
extend their domain south toward the Lippe; however, they did
not desert their original abode, as is evident from the fact that
their name survived in the district called H amaland in the Middle
Ages. ——Angrivarios: they lived along the Weser in modern
Hanover. They retained their tribal unity and their name,
shortened to Angrarii, Angarii, down to the time of Charle-
magne.

3. penitus excisis: nevertheless they are mentioned in sub-
sequent centuries and continued to hold territory between the
Lippe and the Ruhr: their name survived in the medieval can-
ton Borahtra in Westphalia.

5. ne spectaculo quidem: Tacitus uses both the dative and
the ablative after invidere: the ablative of the thing is the more
frequent construction in the Latin of the Empire.
