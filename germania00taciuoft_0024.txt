xvi INTRODUCTION To THE GERMANIA

covered by the H zssstorz'es were staged in Germany‚ and
German raccs were frequent participants in the action,
as is evident even in the fraction of the work that has
come down to us. The necessity of orientating and
instructing the reader would have demanded the in-

’ sertion of a modicum of geographical and ethnological

material. Literary precedent sanctioned the incorpora-
tion of such data in a continuous context. That Tacitus
followed formal practice in this respect, is shown by the
presence of the digression on the Jews and their customs
in the fifth book of the Histories. The stress which he
laid on subject matter of the sort is conspicuously re-
vealed in the Agricola, where he did not hesitate to trans-
gress the canons of the biographical form in order to
insert his account of the British peoples and country.
In such a work as the H istories the extent of an excursus
on Germany would necessarily be curtailed in comparison
with the length of our treatise. Nevertheless, geography,
ethnology, and political history would doubtless be rep-
resented, since all these elements are present in the simi-
lar digiessions in the H zstorzes and the Aqricola.

In origin, therefore, and in kind, the Germania is a
by-product of the historical studies of Tacitus. Whethcr
he designed it to serve essentially as a substitute for an
excursus in the'Hz'stories, dealing with the same data in
briefer compass‚ it is unsafe dogmatically to assert.
Under similar circumstances, a' modern writer would be
disposed to shape a treatise, covering one division of
his field, into a complete preliminary to his greater work
and thereafter to refer his readers to it by cross—reference
and footnote. However, the devices of the literary tech-
nique of the present day cannot be posited without
