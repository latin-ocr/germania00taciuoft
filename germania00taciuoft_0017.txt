INTRODUCTION TO THE GERMANIA

Tnn contents of the Gernmnz'a were grouped by Tacitus

under two main heads, the transition between which is .

indicated in chapter 27. The first of these divisions
proeents an exposition, general in character, of the
geography of the country as a whole and of the universal
features of the national civilization; the second part
deals with the separate tribes and their distinctive traits
and institutions.

In chapter 37 Tacitus gives a resume of the collisions
between Roman and German arms from the invasion of
the Cimbri down to hjs own day. He sets as the chrono-
logical limits of this outline the consulship of Caecilius
Metellus and Papirius Carbo, 113 B.C., and the second
consulate of Trajan, 98 An, Evidently, then, the com-
position of the treatise falls in the latter year, which,
it will be remembered, was marked also by the publica-
tion of the Ayricola. The biographical tribute antedates
the Germania, but the interval between the two works
was at the most a matter of months only.

In the introductory Chapters of all his other works‚
Tacitus takes his readers into his confidence and sets
forth concretely the aims which have actuated him to
treat his subject. In the case of the Germania alone, he
departs from his practice elsewhere, and, with a direct—

ness truly Caesarian, plunges at once into his theme.
