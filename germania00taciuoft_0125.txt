NOTES ’ 93

antea tempus cum Germanos Galli virtute superarent. . . . propter
hominum multitudinem narique inopiam trans Rhenum colonias
mineram this passage is also referred to in Ayricola 11. 14.

2. etiam: said with reference to the countermigration ex-
pressed in quae . . . commiqraverz‘nc above. As a matter of
ethnological fact, the so-called Gauls resident in Germany had
not migrated thither from Gaul, but were remnants of Celtic
peoples who had formerly occupied the territory east of the
thne and had dominated Central Europe until the pressure of
German tribes had largely forced them across the river. —in
Germaniam transgressos: recall that, in chap. 2, Tacitus has

denied the likelihood of migrating tribes being attracted to Ger· '

many. He is, however, speaking primarily of migrations by
sea in earlier times.

5. promiscuas: common property.

6. Hercyniam silvam: in Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 6. 25,
the vast expanse of wooded mountain ranges extending from the
thne along the Danube and northeast to the Vistula. Here
the mountains separating the German Empire and Bohemia,
i.e. the Erzgebirge‚ the Bohmerwald‚ and the Sudetic Mts„ are
referred to.—Rhenumque et Moenum: together forming a
pair and connected with H ercyniam silvam by que. Moenus is
the modern Main.

7. Helvetii: in Caesar's time dwelling in the western part
of Switzerland. Formerly they had held Southwestern Ger-
many, including Western and Northern Bavaria, and parts of
Francom'a‚ Wurtemberg, Baden, and Hesse. Their migrations,
which carried them not only to Switzerland but also into Gaul,
began in the second century 13.c. — ulteriora: east of the Boh-
merwald.

8. Boihaemi: lit. ‘ home of the Boii‚’ whence the modern
name of the territory, Bohemia.

9. mutatis cultoribus: the Boii had long since been expelled,
and the land which bore their name was, in the time of Tacitus,
held by the Marcomannj; cf. chap. 42.

10. Aravisci: they lived west of the modern Budapest‚ in
the territory within the great bend of the Danube. — ab osis:
in Northwestern Hungary, north of the bend of the Danube.
